One is Sphinx, a tail-toting teenage guy, and the other is a mummy.  The graphics in the game are great. Your tail swishes from side to side, the wooden bridges sag beneath your weight, your shadows move along with you. It has a cartoony feel to it, which is fine for its style. The smoke and fire aren't very well done, but those are always tricky. While sound really shouldn't be a key for a game, it is sadly lacking in this one. The background music and ambient noises are OK, usually very faint. But this game has a ton of dialogue and there is no speaking! That might have been fine back in the days of Final Fantasy 8, but in this day and age it really feels lacking every time an important dialogue is going on and there is just ... silence. The actual gameplay is very enjoyable. The characters' movements are smooth and natural, from swinging up a rope to leaping across chasms. Each map has enough area for you to explore and not feel stuck, but it's not so huge that you get lost. There are good assortments of puzzles and action sequences to keep both your fingers and your brain engaged. Sure, a few of the puzzles are a bit hokey - but that's the case in any game. The save feature isn't great, but you learn to deal with that. In general it's a fun game for all ages!</td><td>Great graphics and interesting gameplay</td><td>1070755200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>36983</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>12 7, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006F2ZQ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Metal Gear Solid series is famous for its intense gameplay. Metal Gear Solid 2 adds to the series with combat, stealth, strategy and intrigue. You are Raiden / Snake, part of a covert military group.  The graphics in this game are just amazing. The movements, surroundings, lighting are very well done. You can peer around corners, crouch down, crawl along to sneak up up enemies. The realism isn't quite as nice as some other games out there - it's not \"gritty\" - but it's close. The sounds fit in well with the game. The background music is moody and suspense-filled, and the ambient noises of footfalls and doors opening and closing all reallyd raw you into the game. The gameplay is great, in that it's not a blast-em-up button masher. You have to think about your surroundings and work to take out your enemies in the most efficient way you can. You can replay levels to find new and better ways to get through the level. Where the game drags is in the PLOT. First off, the plot is more like a soap opera, with all sorts of really bizarre twists and interpersonal conflicts. Second, this is supposed to be a stealth-trained guy, a la splinter cell. Instead, he gets these INCREDIBLY long discussions while he's in the middle of a mission! They should have had briefing sessions BEFORE each mission that you could skip, and then when you were actually in the mission you should just do it. There could maybe be an \"on line encyclopedia\" you could go to if you got stuck - but to keep deliberately interrupting the game for these dialogues was poor. Still, you can always have a book nearby to read while those dialogues go on - I hate to skip them just in case something important IS said in them. Usually nothing is, but you never know. If you can last through those cut-scenes, the rest of the game is really enjoyable and well worth playing. It's a lesson in patience!</td><td>Great gameplay but LONG cut scenes</td><td>1070755200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>35647</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>12 7, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000069BCN</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Hitman 2 is a first person shooter which rewards control and stealth over full-out blasting. Gorgeous graphics and freeform gameplay make this great for teenagers and adults.  To start out, you're a retired hitman, enjoying the beauty, peace, and serenity of Sicily, Italy. You talk with your friend, the priest, about your hope for being one with God. Unfortunately for you, this is when the bad guys show up and kidnap the priest. You don't have the $500,000 ransom they demand, so you call up your agency and arrange to do some missions for them in return for help rescuing the priest. And you're off! You're wandering through very well done maps, with a diverse collection of tools at your disposal. Do you pick the locks to go in the back way? Shoot the guy from the trees, sneak up and wire him, maybe chloroform him in a corner? The game is very open-pathed. You choose which way to approach a mission, what might work best. Your opponents are smart and react to finding bodies or to unusual behavior. This isn't a go-here-then-go-there game, it's a game where you're placed in the world and have to decide which approach works best for you. There's a stealth meter, you can hear your footsteps, you can see your shadow. Having just finished playing Splinter Cell, though, the game suffers a bit in comparison. The movements are more jerky, the lighting not nearly as nicely done. You can peer through keyholes, but not around a partially opened door, or shoot around the door. You can't move along walls and peer around the corner. So some stealth techniques we found quite natural and helpful from Spliter Cell were impossible here. Also, the open-endedness of the missions can lead to frustration. Even taking one step two far or opening the wrong door can lead to mission failures, so you can spend hours on a single mission trying to figure out which technique will work. In essence you learn what each AI character does and then work around it - which isn't very realistic.

The game provokes mixed feelings, on one hand coming out only a year after the original L4D (which didn't receive much downloadable content) and on the other hand being full of enough new content to justify a sequel. Like the first L4D, the game puts players in the shoes of four survivors of a zombie apocalypse. The survivors battle waves of the infected to move from one safe area to another. In L4D, the tools used by the survivors were primarily guns and explosive objects like pipe bombs and fuel cans. One of L4D's shortcomings was that it never really felt like \"survival\" - ammo could be found easily, and you were never really short on resources. L4D2 keeps the basic premise - pistols still have infinite ammo, occasional caches of ammo can be found - but generally increases the scarcity of resources to make for a tenser survival experience. In addition, the choice of weaponry is greatly increased from L4D: in addition to a wider range of guns (rather than the 7 offered in L4D, 3 of which were an improved version of the other 3) there are also melee weapons. These allow for close-range damage without needing to reload. There are also more tools and items to be found, like adrenaline that increases your action speed, \"boomer bile\" which causes the infected to fight amongst themselves, and ammo boxes that make your guns shoot burning or explosive ammunition. In addition, there are occasional \"special infected\" with unique abilities who will show up to attack. In L4D, these were the \"hunter\", who pounced on his prey, the \"smoker\", who strangled them with his long tongue, and the \"boomer\", who covered survivors with zombie-attracting bile. In addition, the \"tank\" (a physical powerhouse) and the \"witch\" (a super-powerful zombie who could be avoided if the survivors were careful) also made less-frequent appearances. In L4D2, these special infected are joined by the \"spitter\", who launches gobs of area-covering acid, the \"charger\", who rams into survivors and pummels them, and the \"jockey\", who jumps on a survivor and attempts to steer them into nearby hazards. The new special infected affect the balance of the game overall - the spitter forces survivors to keep moving instead of holing up in one spot and the jockey uses environmental hazards to his advantage. The charger is a little annoying, because even if you spot it early, unlike the other special infected it can take so many bullets that you usually end up getting hit anyways. There are five campaigns, all with much more unique layouts than the campaigns in L4D. \"Dead Center\" is a fight through a shopping mall, \"Dark Carnival\" takes place in an amusement park, \"Swamp Fever\" sees the survivors attempting to get through the bayou, \"Hard Rain\" involves a two-way trip to get gas during a major thunderstorm, and finally \"The Parish\" puts you on the streets of New Orleans attempting to reach the last helicopter out. The maps are all much more fleshed out than they are in L4D, and due to the expanded list of items and bonuses in the game there's much more potential benefit to exploring out-of-the-way locations like abandoned houses. There's also more choice in route, though the paths are always ultimately linear. The campaigns on the whole feel much more unique and thematic than their L4D counterparts, and there's a distinct flavor to each of them. There are more game modes than in L4D. In addition to the regular campaign (human players versus ai-controlled infected), survival (players hold out for as long as they can in one area), and the versus mode (player-controlled survivors versus player-controlled special infected), there's also realism mode (a campaign wherein many elements like glowing silhouettes are disabled, making it harder for players to find each other without good teamwork) and scavenge mode (where players try to collect gas cans and bring them back to a central location). The versus mode is much more fun than in L4D because of the new special infected, but the new game modes are sort of iffy. Overall, L4D2 is a great game - much improved over its predecessor - but it still feels like it's lacking a lot. The new melee weapons are all basically identical, so there's no real sense of scavenging or anything like that. Everything from a fire axe to a cricket bat is completely capable of tearing apart a zombie with one swing. The new guns are a little better - I liked the idea of adding a grenade launcher that has non-replenishable ammo - but they're so easy to find that there's still really no tension. Basically, though, the game is an action game, not a survival game. If you want to have fun playing cooperatively with your friends, L4D2 is probably the best game to do it with.

At the time, most children only had options like Dick and Jane ... nothing that captured the imagination. The Grinch certainly was a fresh, exciting change! A classic that many associate easily with the holiday season, the Grinch is a mean-hearted grouch that simply hates everything about caring, and giving, and sharing. He sets forth to destroy the holidays for the delightfully innocent Whos in Who-ville. His plans are brought to a crashing halt when he realizes that the Whos do not care about the presents and trapings he stole - they are joyfully happy because they have each other, and they have the celebration of the day. This knowledge converts the Grinch into a kinder, gentler creature. It's really a powerful message for just about anyone in this commercial age - that in the end it's not the boxes and shiny paper under the tree, it's the joy and happiness of being together and sharing this special season. Best of all, this message isn't given in an overbearing manner. It's done in an extremely lighthearted, open and joyous storytelling with GORGEOUS graphics and a deft touch. I loved this book as a child, and I love it even more as an adult, reading it to my own child. Grab yourself a copy or two, and give it out to friends. You'd be surprised how much meaning this simple book still holds.</td><td>A true classic for readers of all ages</td><td>975974400</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>45020</td><td>4.0</td><td>16</td><td>false</td><td>12 4, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00008XPJH</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Lord of the Rings trilogy has been getting quite popular in the past few years. It was inevitable that the original story - of Bilbo Baggins finding the ring - would become a new computer game.  Bilbo Baggins is enlisted by Gandalf to go along with a group of dwarves to explore and steal back a treasure from the dragon Smaug. As you go you gain skill with your sword and courage for your hobbit brain. The game is on the cutesy side and bears no resemblance to the movie hobbits. It's more based on the infamous cartoon version of the Hobbit by Arthur Rankin Jr, with round-bellied short creatures that refuse to talk of adventure. The game involves a lot of jumping from pillar to pillar and going on eternal quests fetching needles and hammers and nails. Yes, there's bashing involved too, mostly of the jump-and-slash, jump-and-slash, jump-and-slash kind. Don't get me wrong - I *love* Lord of the Rings and will eagerly buy any game based on the series. But I also love great gameplay. I would play Zelda for months and months, and the games based on the movies in the Lord of the Rings trilogy were superb. This one is on the cute side and is more about running through bushes and shrubs gathering up \"courage gems\" than any actual real thought. You could easily win this game in a few hours. Sure, you can then go back and find \"every last gem\" ... but really, running around every square inch of ground hoping mysterious gems pop out of the ground isn't my idea of fun. I'd recommend renting this one and playing it for a weekend. You'll easily win the game several times in that period. If you still find the game fun, buy yourself a copy and enjoy! But if you've tired of the incessant repetitive music, jumping platform areas and tediously long speeches by then, you'll be quite happy to trade the game back in and get something else. I recommend Return of the King - now there's a game I love playing over and over!</td><td>Rent first, buy only if you still enjoy it</td><td>1070496000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>home</td><td>266450</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 31, 2013</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0001J05IC</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>This review is for the Venta Airwasher Humidifier LW15 WHITE unit. We have used many, many humidifiers over the years. We have forced hot water heat and the house gets incredibly dry in the winter. We have parakeets, cats, and a plethora of plants, so it's important to us to keep the house at a decent humidity level. It's of course good for us humans as well :). So when we were offered a review copy of this Venta LW15 unit, we jumped at it. How much better could it be compared with all these other humidifiers we've tried? The Venta has two speeds - high and low. Even on high, the fan is not crazy loud. We can watch TV with the unit nearby. I'll note of course it's not SILENT. The quietest humidifier we have is an ultrasonic. But the ultrasonic can't handle the volume that this LW15 does. The LW15 works with a turning plastic wheel. That wheel turns, water fills in the gaps, and the water then comes out into the room. So there's no filter to change. Just a turning plastic wheel to clean. We were impressed that this seems to be one of the most intelligently built humidifiers we've used. The fan sucks dry air down and blows it out over the water wheel, vs the water-laden air going over the fan mechanism and slowly damaging it. So to reiterate, this unit doesn't need any filters. Because there's nothing interacting with the water like a filter, you only need to add a liquid additive every few weeks. That additive doesn't evaporate or get wicked away so you don't need to replace it with every refill. The unit has a detector for emptiness, which would seem like a no-brainer, but we have several units that do NOT know when they are empty and just keep running. So it gets credit for that. On the other hand, since this is a turning wheel apparatus, by the time it gets to no water, it's already been running fairly ineffectively for a while. So it'd be nice if it had a yellow light when it was getting low, so you could refill it then. The effectiveness seems to vary with amount of water in it. As the water levels goes down, it doesn't seem to humidify as well. Again, this has to do with the wheel design. For some strange reason, there's no humidity detection. The unit is either on or off. That's it. This baffles us. Having a unit that knows when to run and not to run is fairly basic. Also, in terms of \"forcing\" the air to become fairly humid, this unit can't do that. It's not blasting vapor into air. It's just presenting water to the air that the air CAN pick up if it's a bit dry. So in general we find that our room won't go higher than 50% because air won't pick up the water any more. But it works nicely to get a room into the 40-50% range. It has a nice, large capacity - 1.3 gallons. Also - and this is great!! - the filling bin sits flat in the sink. It's very nice for filling. Again you'd think all units should do this, but so many that we own have bizarre, art-deco style tanks which don't sit flat in the sink. It makes them a royal pain to fill. You can add fragrance oil into the water. We've tested this out and it does add a nice aroma to the room. This isn't something you can normally do with the filter style units. A final nice feature - when you refill it, it remembers the speed it was on before. Many units completely forget everything and you have to start again. Not a huge deal, but it's nice. Well recommended. This unit is fairly similar to the LW45, which we also reviewed.

Age of Empires II - The Age of Kings stands the test of time. This is a game that is fun even years after its release. You would think a game created in 1999 would seem blocky and old after only a year or two. Quite the contrary. The gameplay, immersion in detail, and strategic fun in Age of Empires II makes it into a game that I envision will be playable and fun for years to come. The game takes you through a variety of situations. You need to be an efficient hunter-gatherer. You have to know how to manage naval warfare. It's a great test of your ability to think outside the box, as you investigate and manage a new set of challenges with every pass. I adore history, so it was a treat to be in a scenario with William Wallace and Joan of Arc. You see the real life locations they had to fight through, and you save the day with your own activities. The locations span the globe, keeping things interesting. I realize that some people aren't interested in multiplayer and certainly there is enough here in the game to keep a solo player happy. However, those who do love multiplayer will be in for a treat. The game does an excellent job of keeping all sides engaged in the battle. I happen to love the multiplayer aspect here. Yes, the graphics aren't super high def and up to current standards. That is quite all right by me. The gameplay itself is well done, and really after a few minutes I don't even notice what the details of the various structures look like. I am too busy racing around the screen planning my defenses. As long as the on screen icons are easy to identify and work with, that's all that matters to me. Are there any downsides? I imagine gamers who are most focused on first person shooters, who want to aim rifles at heads and shoot, probably won't be as keen on the strategy based, long term planning involved here. That is quite fine. There are different types of games for different players. For strategy fans, Age of Empires II is quite a treat.

Age of Mythology takes that engine, beefs up the graphics again and adds in populus-like god power! First, I have to admit that I am a huge Age of Empires fan. I asked everybody around me to play with me, and played it solo just about every chance I could get. I thought the graphics and gameplay and customization were just great. I'm also a populus player from way back, and have eagerly played each release of Populus and Black & White. I enjoy the god-games very much. So Age of Mythology was just about the perfect game that I could ask for! How did it meet my expectations? First, gameplay is just like in Age of Empires. These guys have made a number of games in the Age of Empires series and have received feedback on each set of changes they made. At this point the interface and training are WELL honed and very easy to use. The tutorial helps guide you quickly and easily through learning the system. The graphics are simply amazing. The gorgeous intro video is classic. The in-game graphics are great - just watch those waves lap up on the beach! It's a true pleasure to play. The sounds are well matched to each culture you play, with the characters speaking in the appropriate language for 'background chatter' and ambient noises coming in. It's not intended to be fully immersive like Myst 3 - this is a strategy game, not a RPG. But they do a good job with the sounds. The cultures you choose from are Egyptian, Greek, and Norse. In each culture you have appropriate buildings and troops, plus the gods to choose from. At each stage in development you choose a new additional god to pray to which gives you access to new powers. Some of the powers are pretty amazing! Multiplayer, as always, shines in this game. You can create maps with all the terrain types, devise your own battle situations, play on line against thousands of other Age of Empire enthusiasts. The gameplay that comes with the game is just the start - on line multiplay is where you really test out your strategic thinking. My complaint with the game is that it's too limited in the cultures and gods you get. They have an incredible engine that has been developed over the years, and it shines - but you only get 3 cultures. And those three cultures have very few gods. The 'cheat sheets' that come with the game make it seem like you have a lot of gods and a lot of combinations, but look more closely - it's just the same gods listed in three columns. Undoubtedly their plan is to get people hooked on Age of Mythology, and then slowly dole out new cultures and new gods over time, making us pay for each additional one. If they'd at least started us with five or six cultures that might not have been as bad, but three is sort of flimsy. Still, I'll be playing this for months, and when those expansions come out, I'll be there to buy them!

It is not just the trio of the zerg, protoss, and terran with their well balanced arsenals. It is the whole plot and atmosphere which shine. StarCraft was one of the first strategy games I played where I got swept up into the storyline and became fond of the individual character types. Even many years later I still refer to the \"zerglings\" and remember the behavior of the individual troop types. The game is incredibly fun just in single player mode, moving through the missions, refining and perfecting your skill with each of the three groups. Where it shines for me, though, is when you take it into multiplayer and take on other humans. The possibilities are pretty much endless. With all the troop types, and the various ways to use them, you can always find a fresh, interesting challenge. We definitely own games that we played once, had a fun time doing so, and then put the game away never to be touched again. We have games that we wrote five star reviews when they came out but barely remember them several years later. This is NOT the case with StarCraft. We adored it when it came out, we kept playing it, and even years later we are strong advocates of the game. Perhaps the only trouble you could have in modern times is that, because the game was released for Windows 95 and Windows NT, you might have difficulties playing the game on a just-released system. The game is, after all, from 1997. However, I just tested the game out on my 2010 laptop which is running Windows Vista. It ran without a problem. I logged into Battle.net and there were currently 137 StarCraft games running! I'm not sure how many other 13 year old games you could find this kind of enthusiasm for. Are there any downsides? Sure, the graphics are a little blocky compared with current high def games. Still, the minute I launched into my Zerg world, I was oblivious to any minor issues with the older resolution. The underlying plot and gameplay were all there. The same is just *fun*. Highly recommended!

We got an Xbox 360 base unit right when it first came out, and we play *constantly*. It was very easy to get those 20 gig of space on the basic hard drive filled up with all sorts of things. We had music to play as background music in some games, we had lots of game demos we were trying out. We had videos to watch and downloadable games from the marketplace. We definitely needed more space. For graphics, we can easily notice that the video quality from the HDMI feed is better than what we were getting from the high def feed on the regular Xbox 360. The regular one offers component (red-green-blue) as its only high def feed. So if you're a gamer with a high def TV and want the best quality signal, you'll be happy about this HDMI output. Yes, you get a black wireless controller, a black headset and Live Silver membership along with this package. But really, most Xbox gamers have those things already. And most of them have Gold Live, since without Gold you can't play online. So these three things are certainly nice to have, but not a reason you would buy the Elite system. The package comes with a single disc containing 2 games - Forza and Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Both are old games and not that thrilling; we had them already. Still, free games are at least things you can give away to friends. Perhaps best of all, the Elite has a new motherboard inside it which is much more reliable. It's called a FALCON.

It works for any 360 * Turn your 360 off and take off the hard drive and remove the game. * Turn the unit upside down. * Put a flashlight directly against the bottom grill. * Look in from the SIDE grill at the inside of your 360.

We got an Xbox 360 base unit right when it first came out, and we play *constantly*. It was very easy to get those 20 gig of space on the basic hard drive filled up with all sorts of things. We had music to play as background music in some games, we had lots of game demos we were trying out. We had videos to watch and downloadable games from the marketplace. We definitely needed more space. For graphics, we can easily notice that the video quality from the HDMI feed is better than what we were getting from the high def feed on the regular Xbox 360. The regular one offers component (red-green-blue) as its only high def feed. So if you're a gamer with a high def TV and want the best quality signal, you'll be happy about this HDMI output. Yes, you get a black wireless controller, a black headset and Live Silver membership along with this package. But really, most Xbox gamers have those things already. And most of them have Gold Live, since without Gold you can't play online. So these three things are certainly nice to have, but not a reason you would buy the Elite system. The package comes with a single disc containing 2 games - Forza and Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Both are old games and not that thrilling; we had them already. Still, free games are at least things you can give away to friends. Perhaps best of all, the Elite has a new motherboard inside it which is much more reliable. It's called a FALCON. How can you tell what motherboard your Xbox 360 has? Here's the trick.  It works for any 360 * Turn your 360 off and take off the hard drive and remove the game. * Turn the unit upside down. * Put a flashlight directly against the bottom grill. * Look in from the SIDE grill at the inside of your 360. If you see 3 red rings that \"stick up\" from the green motherboard, you have an old launch motherboard. If you see 3 red rings that \"lay flat\" on that motherboard, it's the middle Zephyr version. If you have only TWO red rings that lay flat, you've got a Falcon! I highly recomend having an Xbox 360 in your house for gaming, and I highly recommend going with the Elite. The hard drive space is VERY useful, the HDMI graphics are great, and having a 360 in general is just superb.  Again, we literally play with the 360 all the time and rarely touch our other systems. The whole reason we had to get an Elite is that we were fighting over who could play on the 360 even though we have all these other game systems in the house. Highly recommended.</td><td>Elite Version is Well Worth Having</td><td>1199059200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>63056</td><td>4.0</td><td>21</td><td>false</td><td>12 30, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0007KTBG2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Spyro, the purple dragon, has been a favorite of mine since he first came out. Now he's flying, romping and bashing his way through a shadow realm. If you're used to the more modern games, the first thing you'll notice here is that it is a pretty - but flat - display. You get a really odd \"slanted, from the forward, top down\" view not seen in pretty much any game. It makes the proportions of the room very odd and at times very hard to figure out. Is that line in the back of the room a wall, or is it a higher level of a shelf? The backgrounds of the outdoor scenes are really pretty, in a sort of water color sort of way. You walk or run around, charging at enemies, talking to friends, and performing the quests or tasks as necessary. I expect a hobbit to plod around slowly, but when I'm playing Spyro, I expect the little purple dragon to be alert and agile. It's much more frustrating to see him plod along slowly, getting stuck on the corners of walls, or moving into a \"fast walk\" for the charge action. They did add more complexity to the game by adding in some RPG style elements. You earn experience points by killing off enemies, and you use those to build up your Spyro character. The lower screen lets you perform traditional RPG activities - manage your inventory, look at a general map, track your progress - while the upper screen is your general gameplay area. On sound, the game is reasonably OK. It doesn't stand out in any way, but it's not awful either. For people who are fond of the previous Spyro games, with their great three dimensional graphics and focus on arcade quality gameplay, will probably be disappointed here. It is sluggish and relatively low quality for the DS's capabilities. On the other hand, for players who are new to RPGs, this is a cuddly, easy to learn RPG that draws you into it with lots of explanation and hand holding. Recommended for those seeking to learn how RPGs work!</td><td>Fun for New RPGers - Spyro Fans might feel Let Down</td><td>1167436800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>463370</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>12 30, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000CSUKXW</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Garfield and his Nine Lives is a GameBoy Advance adventure game featuring the always hungry tabby cat and his cartoon friends. The game is a side scrolling adventure much like Super Mario, but featuring Garfield as the main character. He can run, jump, and kick enemies. He goes through a series of themed levels such as a circus, farm, haunted house, and other interesting locations. In each ones the enemies are what you might expect - foxes, ghosts, bats, and so on. Nothing overly scary, and while many of them are challenging, they're all quite doable even for youngsters. There are three difficulty settings, so that tykes and adults can find a challenge they will enjoy. Also, you can have the dialogue in English, Spanish or French - so if you're trying to learn a new language, this could be a fun way to do it! Not that there's a lot of talk in this game. You get a few quips and jokes along the way, but that's about it. Each level has a basic task - gather up the eggs, find the key. Each game also has bonus tasks - find all the coffee cups. Back on the main screen, you can see which levels you've beaten and what remains on each one, as well as what difficulty you took that level on. That way you can work on levels one at a time, choosing your favorites and ramping the difficulty up step by step until you can get a perfect score on the hardest level. The sounds are what you'd expect from a GameBoy Advance title - cutesy music and silly sound effects. You eat lasagna to regain your health, of course! There are some downsides here. Some of the monsters can become quite annoying. For example, one enemy \"bounces you back\" - and you can get between two of them, and they get you stuck in the middle. I had one monster bounce me back \"into\" a decorative box, and it was a few minutes before the game let me get back out of it again. Still, the game is great fun for Garfield fans.</td><td>Fun Basic Platformer for Garfield Fans</td><td>1167436800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>67836</td><td>5.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>12 30, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009R1SQY</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Age of Empires - Age of Kings for the Nintendo DS is not just a straight port of the fun real time strategy game. Instead, it's a turn based version based on the same missions. Let me first say that several people have had issues of this gaming locking up on their DS. I haven't had this problem at all with mine. The creators of Age of Empires - Age of Kings say that this is a known problem if your profile name (i.e your DS name) is only 3 or less characters long. If you are running into crashing problems and you are sure your profile name is MORE than four characters long, please let me know so I can research further. OK, on to gamplay. I really wish they could have done a straight port of the great real time strategy game to the DS, but I understand that this little unit just couldn't handle the graphics and speed necessary. They did a nice job of downgrading the game just enough to work on the DS while keeping a lot of what made it so fun. The library has all sorts of great background information on the different cultures you meet, and you start out with a wonderfully done tutorial featuring Joan of Arc. You can learn about each stage of the game, or easily listen to some while skipping the others. They do a good job of ramping up the challenges slowly so that it's not a cake-walk at any stage, but you can achieve the objectives given. You have standard unit and terrain issues to keep track of - horse units don't do well while mired in a swamp, and archers do best if they're up on high ground, shooting down at their helpless enemies. The graphics are reasonably well done. The cut scenes and animations look really nice, but I found the actual in-game map to be a bit cluttered. Sometimes it was really challenging to pick out which specific unit I wanted to work with, and get it into the spot I needed. It would have been nice if there were more zoom / rotate / detail graphic options so that you could, for example, turn off the detailed graphics and just have letter representations of troops when you ran into that situation. The sounds were reasonably well done, with music that tried to represent whatever culture and era you were working with.

It's actually quite fun, strategizing your order of attack and spinning into action! Your favorite characters of Star Fox are in trouble, and need to a series of enemies. First, you get the overall top-down map screen. Each character's ship can fly a certain amount of distance in a turn - simply draw a line to say where they go. Use the stylus to wipe out some of the 'fog of war', and your main ship can shoot missiles. You only have a certain number of turns available, so plan your movements wisely. When your ship encounters an enemy ship, you switch into real time combat. In this mode, you drag your stylus around on the bottom screen to \"steer\" while the top screen shows you where you're flying. You fly through rings to get power-ups, and shoot at enemies (with the D-pad on the left) to fire. It really is quite intuitive - no up/down, left/right issues. Simply drag your stylus as the ship flies. You spin your stylus in a circle to do the classic barrel roll, and there are two easy-access spots to tap to do a U-turn or a loop. I love space combat, and it was really fun to have this type of game available on a handheld. I kept expecting to put the game down after a mission - but I'd say \"just one more ...\" and keep going. Note that these missions aren't easy! Expect to have to replay some of them several times to get through. You do have to learn the strategies and tactics of three dimensional combat. The game expects you to go through a single pass rather quickly - but the beauty is that you then go back and re-play it, now having new options available at every stage. Instead of just contacting Slippy, now you have other choices you can do instead that are more difficult. You choose at each step what to do, and it affects the types of missions you take on and the endings you get to see. Think of it as built in difficulty levels. A key element of space combat games are the visuals - with you trying to move and think real time in three dimensions, it's critical that you can see the terrain, your enemies, and anything else that might get in the way. While the DS graphics in general are nice, it wasn't always easy to see what you were fighting. The graphics were sometimes unclear - the ship's faded graphic would blend right in to the background's faded graphic. Also, your ship is right in the center of the screen, and takes up a fair amount of it. This makes it challenging if you're right behind a ship, to see it. Surely they could have given you an in-cockpit view or at least a transparent ship. For vocals, they give you the high pitched gibberish that means it's perfect for all languages. No need to do new vocal tracks for this game! Still, in modern times, it would be nice to have a regular vocal track available. It adds a whole additional dimension of enjoyment when you have great voice actors bringing life to the characters. Still, this is a superb game for the DS, and one I really enjoy.

I was very intrigued when Pilate's Wife came out - offering to cover this same time period from the point of view of Pontius Pilate's dream-seeing partner. I *love* the Mists of Avalon story, where dream-seeing young Morgause is brought up by her mom and powerfully-driven aunt. I immediately saw the similarities here. Both begin with a young girl on the cusp of womanhood, seeing visions, which the adults around her sometimes dismiss and sometimes pay attention to. With Claudia, she grows up in a military family, only coming into the grand city of Rome after a childhood in army camps. Her family is extremely powerful, so she mixes with the high and mighty, sitting besides Tiberius at the gladiator games, living the high life. In short time she has dedicated herself to Isis (against her father's wishes), become obsessed with Pilate and drugs him with a love potion, then marries him. But all the not-so-subtle warnings of the potion provider go right over her head - he quickly starts having affairs. Soon she becomes obsessed with a muscular gladiator and starts sleeping with him. It's only at the very end of the book that she actually runs into Jesus, and it's a Forest Gump situation - suddenly she's at every key scene with him. I was surprised that she wasn't at the Last Supper somehow. There are many aspects of the story which I really enjoyed. I liked the descriptions of the lives of the Vestal Virgins, the political intrigues of Tiberius, the descriptions of ancient towns of all sizes and styles. The story kept me involved and reading to the end through one sitting. This is my own bias, but it really bugged me that Mary Magdalene was presented in this story as a whore. This was a mistake made by Pope Gregory in 591 which propagated until 1969, when the Vatican admitted the error. The fact that a modern book *still* has to say that the only way this wealthy woman could support Jesus was by selling her body irks me to no end. I'm quite fine with the theory - true or invented - that Jesus married her. We know he loved her, and that can be interpreted as a loyal follower or as someone he kissed and was intimate with. But in this book she was cast out by her family for being raped, then makes her fortune by sleeping around with wealthy men. Jesus' mom dislikes Mary quite vehemently and is sulky at their wedding. Another nit-pick which bugged me is that when (in again a Forest Gump situation) Claudia runs into Jesus as a child in Egypt, Jesus says his name is Yeshua, known by the Romans as Jesus. Hah! If he went around telling people his name was Yeshua as a child, that is what they would call him. In *Greek writing* the name is Iesus since Greek doesn't have a Y or sh letter, and then they put Ss at the end of their names. So that would be pronounced eeae-soos . The only reason there is a J in there is because of the Germans, who use the J letter for a I sound. They also meant for it to be said eeae-soos. It's only the ignorant English who saw that and started pronouncing it with a J sound. That was *long* long after his death. So the English all mis-pronounce his name. Many researchers feel that the reason the gospels slanted towards Jews caused it all, the friendly Romans tried their best to stop it was because the gospels were written during times the Romans were in power. It's like a newspaper in Germany in WWII slanting pro-Germany. It's something that happens. To have this book push so heavily that it was all the nasty Jews' fault - those poor Romans were completely on Jesus' side seemed unrealistic to me. The book slips into the ha ha we future people can laugh at your past mistaken ideas situation a few times. The characters will make comments along the lines of Nobody will remember this silly messiah in the future that we the reader are supposed to chuckle at. I don't mind these when they are subtle and fit into the storyline, but the ones here were rather on the blatant side. For some reason, I also found the clothing discussions confusing. I do enjoy visualizing what the characters look like and how typical dress was worn - but the use of strange terms without enough description of how they looked or were worn made it hard to do. It actually got frustrating when the story would then mention a term, because it was a reminder that I still didn't know what that item was. In general, I had trouble sympathizing with Claudia. While Morgause in Mists of Avalon was smart and engaging - even while she had typical angst and issues during her life - Claudia seemed incredibly self absorbed and shallow. All she wants is to dedicate herself to Isis. No wait, all she wants is Pilate by her side. Oh wait, all she wants is her uncle to live, forget how Pilate feels. Wait, all she wants is to rut with a gladiator she saw once or twice. I suppose you could argue that she has to go with the do what you want NOW, damn the consequences lifestyle because all around her she sees betrayals at any moment. Her sister, for one brief teen sexual encounter, is condemned to a life as a celibate. When she later has a sexual encounter, she is buried alive. Her parents both are forced to commit suicide. Her uncle is cursed and dies. She has a miscarriage. Other cousins of hers are slain. Still, it would have been nice to get the sense that she was making these choices rationally. I hate to keep comparing the book to Mists, but in Mists you really got a sense of the power of the attraction between Morgause and the men she fell for - and the difficulty of some of the decisions she made. In Pilate's Wife, it was more like a fleeting thought passed through her brain, and she became obsessed with it. I think if the story had revolved around random nobility that these issues wouldn't have bothered me nearly the same. The issue is that Antoinette May is writing about very important people in history - people who have been researched and studied. It's the same issue as with the Da Vinci Code. You need to get those basic, important facts correct if we are going to be able to immerse ourselves in the world. If there are inaccuracies, it jars you out of that immersion. Still, even though I kept hitting issues that made me wince, the general storytelling drew me along, and as I mentioned, I did read the book straight through and enjoyed it. So go into it knowing that these things exist, and read it for what it does offer. If Antoinette writes her next book about less well known people, I think I'll enjoy it much more!</td><td>Flaws bug me - but the plot sucked me in</td><td>1167436800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>72144</td><td>4.0</td><td>14</td><td>false</td><td>12 3, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000AMF76A</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Ridge Racer is a classic racing game that gives you fake cars, fake tracks, and fun arcade style racing. We've played both Project Gotham Racing and Need for Speed. All 3 games feature really well done car models with incredible reflections and details. In all 3 cases, the high definiton tracks and details really shine. All 3 games really take advantage of the XBox 360's high level of graphics. In Ridge Racer, you're dealing with fake track layouts - so you don't get to see the cool streets of New York, Las Vegas, or other locations. On the other hand, the locations done are all modelled on cool locations - you see bridges, streets and locations that seem quite familiar. The same is true with the cars. They don't have real models here - you get the Derota and other cars that are similar to real styles but not quite there. This probably saves them some money on licensing costs, but I have to admit that it's not nearly as cool to be driving a Derota as to drive say a Porshe. But really, Ridge Racer isn't about authenticity. It's about pure arcade fun. When you smash into walls, your car isn't even damaged. You don't get hurt at all when you play bumper-car games with your competitors. Really, this is about fast-blasting fun with an emphasis on sliding and nitro. When you skid around corners, you build up your nitro boost power. Build up enough power, and you can blast past your enemies with a WHOOSH of speed. It's really cool looking at the 'world view' of all the races, laid out as hexagons with interconnecting paths. You can choose a variety of routes to get to new races, unlocking new cars and colors as you go. There are over 100 different races to run, each with different twists and turns. That makes for great replayability on your own, never mind going up against friends to see who can corner the best. It's definitely a fun racer, and even if you have the other racing games, I'd suggest you at least rent it to try it out. Sometimes it's fun to have a game that you can just blast and slide away at without having to put serious though into strategy and turn speed dynamics.  It does exactly what it's meant to do - provide hours of fun!</td><td>Great Arcade Style Fun</td><td>1133568000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>73595</td><td>5.0</td><td>165</td><td>false</td><td>12 3, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000B6ML32</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>If you've got a base XBox 360 core unit, you really need to find yourself a hard drive. The hard drive lets you save music, store games, download content, and even play old XBox games. In the original XBox, every XBox unit had a built in hard drive. This was inconvenient for several reasons. First, there were people who never used it, but who had to pay for it anyway. Next, if your XBox died, it was a royal pain because the hard drive wasn't removable. You could try to move items off your hard drive onto memory units, but many save games were simply too large to fit on a memory unit. The XBox 360 has a great improvement - you can buy the XBox 360 with or without the hard drive. You can even buy the hard drive separate if you want to upgrade your XBox 360 later on. If your hard drive fries, you don't have to get an entire new XBox 360, you just buy a new hard drive. If your XBox 360 fries, you don't lose your information, you simply pop out the hard drive and plug it into a new XBox 360 unit. The XBox 360 hard drive lets you download content from XBox Live onto it - this can include new maps for games, new levels, even songs and videos. You can store your own CDs on the unit, which is fantastic for playing your own soundtracks during games. It even comes with a free copy of Hexic HD - a tetris-like game that is really quite addictive. You find it under the 'Xbox Live Arcade' menu choice. You don't need XBox Live to play it - it's fully playable when you are off line. This really is a must-have for any XBox 360 gamer - highly recommended!</td><td>Must-Have for XBox 360 Systems</td><td>1133568000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>4097</td><td>4.0</td><td>16</td><td>true</td><td>12 28, 1999</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00000K3DM</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>We waited quite a while for Dungeon Keeper 2 to come out, and bought it immediately when it did. On one hand, it's great for a sequel. People who played DK1 will easily be able to pick up on moving units, building rooms,  lining corridors with traps. The graphics are better in the sense that  they're more geared towards future development. Instead of pixel-based  graphics, the creatures and rooms are now drawn with polygons. While that  makes some of the monsters look clumsy, it does mean that future graphics  will be much smoother and cleaner. Going down into your dungeon by  possessing a creature does not cause the creatures to turn into a cloud of  dots - the rooms you roam through are still crisp and easy to see. Roaming  through your own dungeons is one of the true pleasures of this game,  too! There are only a few extra rooms - you'd have hoped for much more  from a sequel that took this long to make. The casino is neat, if only  because a jackpot-winning minion starts dancing and singing when he wins.  (Disco Inferno!) Rooms have better graphics, though. The hen-houses in  the hatchery, the on-wall bookshelves and torture racks, everything shows a  subtle touch. If choosing between DK1 and DK2, I'd definitely recommend  people get this game. The challenges and gameplay in DK2 are better than  DK1, and DK1 has many new extra features like Pet Dungeons. New players  will appreciate having a well crafted game that is a fun challenge, while  experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between the old  and new version.

With Soul Caliber Legends, they tried to convert the series into an RPG. RGP fans will probably find it lacking, but Soul Caliber fans will appreciate the new look at their world. First, the gameplay. In single player / campaign mode you go through a series of minor battles up until you hit a boss, like many typical RPGs. You swing the Wii remote around like a sword in order to make your attacks. The direction of the swing does matter - for example left-to-right acts differently than right-to-left. You can get a good workout playing this for a while! That being said, the gameplay gets rather repetitive very quickly. There isn't a lot of thought or finesse involved. Also, the game itself is exceedingly short. You can finish the entire game in one day. With a fighting game you have a lot of incentive to keep playing, either alone or with friends, but here once the game is over, you really don't feel impelled to go back to it. Normally in games like these the basic game is simple because the multiplayer is then complex and rich. However, Soul Caliber Legends doesn't offer much in this area. There are a few co-op, a few head-to-head and that's about it. The graphics are a real mixed bag. In some cases, they are really very lovely and detailed. Whoever designed the wood parquet floor should get a gold star. On the other hand, some of the items are hideous looking, as if they were transplanted from a Nintendo-64. I could complain about the tiny bikini outfit that they put the female into, but that's an issue with Soul Caliber as a whole, not just with this game. The sound is equally mixed. Sometimes it seems almost good quality - and then at other times the dialogue makes you want to cringe. If this was a fighting game it might not matter much - but in an RPG, the whole point is the role playing environment, and it raelly stands out. We've played a lot of so-so games through, and this was one we just lost interest in after a while. It's not engaging. And we are Soul Caliber fans, so we were the target audience for this game. I'd suggest this as a game to rent first, and then buy if you find you enjoy it.

This makes the game very challenging. It's important to realize that the Wii has lower quality graphics than the PS3 and XBox 360 - they did this on purpose to keep the price down. It also means that normally the Wii aims towards cartooney games where it doesn't matter at all. With Call of Duty 3, the game is a much more realistic, WWII shooter. You need precise visuals to be able to see your camo-covered enemy in amongst the rubble. Where this was a challenge in the PS3 version, it was bordering on extremely difficult on the Wii because of the pixels. We love Call of Duty 3 in general - the open gameplay, the realistic environments, the storyline. We were really looking forward to the Wii controllers letting us \"live\" the experience. While some actions were pretty straightforward and became second nature after playing for a while, others were never quite right because of the Wii remote design. Buttons weren't within easy reach. The sound was exactly the same high quality as on other platforms - thundering gunfire, screams and shouts of your friends and enemies. You really get immersed into the fog of war. I also wonder why they didn't offer a widescreen version, or multi-play. The Wii obviously supports both modes, we've seen multiplay in other games and widescreen in other games. To have black bars down the left and right of the screen didn't make a lot of sense, when the game was obviously done widescreen for other platforms. And part of the whole fantastic play-for-months feature of the Call of Duty series is that the single play mode is just training for the real challenge of multi-play. Is it really hard to kill off the enemy soldiers when they keep coming in, one after the other, through the same door that they just saw their friends die in? If you snipe someone out of a spot, a friend will leap into the exact same spot to take his place. I longed for real humans to challenge me. Still, if you're a shooter fan and only have a Wii, this is definitely better than previous-generation games. It's a step up, a step in the right direction. And, with this being a launch title, I cut them some slack for not quite having figured out the best ways to use the joystick and to hone the graphics.</td><td>Better than Old Gen but With a Few Flaws</td><td>1167091200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>89228</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>12 26, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000GJ0J1A</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Far Cry Vengeance is yet another part of the continuing saga of tropical shooters. We've played this on many platforms and found the Wii to offer new challenges. The basic gist of the game is that you're a lone fighter trying to survive in tropical terrain. You're surrounded by palm trees, thick grass and wooden huts. You've got a variety of realistic weapons and have to snipe, bash and shoot your way out of situations. A lot of this game involves stealthily sneaking through thick stands of grass, watching for enemies, keeping an eye out for signs of movement. Graphics therefore can be extremely important here. The Wii gives you reasonably good graphics, but definitely not up to the quality of PC or current-gen systems. This can make some of your sneaking a bit challenging. Also, there's no wide screen option, which I find quite odd. I realize it can't be high def, but other Wii games do offer the wide screen mode. The sound is a mixed bag. When you are sneaking around, it does a great job of giving quiet bird calls, your footsteps, ocean noises and such to immerse you. You can throw a rock to make a distracting noise. However, sometimes you get a blaring rock-music overlay which completely destroys all of this :) I like how the Wii controllers work here. Throwing a grenade, jumping, it is all pretty intuitive. However, when you point your controller off-screen, instead of \"turning faster\", it just jams and shows an exclamation point. Maybe these developers weren't quite used to this new control system yet to understand how to best implement it. The AI is a bit odd. Let's say you're standing behind someone and try a few times, unsuccessfully, to thwap them. They just stand there until you do connect! Don't they hear or feel all those near-misses? There's in-home multiplayer with a split screen option which can be quite fun, if you've got friends around to play against. All in all, the graphics aren't stellar, but if all you have is a Wii in your home, the game is pretty fun.</td><td>Clunky Graphics but Fun Gameplay</td><td>1167091200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>50254</td><td>3.0</td><td>18</td><td>false</td><td>12 25, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000AOE9K</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Sudeki is a role playing game where you control four different types of characters, battling your way through magic warfare and gunfights. Your four characters are a swordsman, gunfighter, female spellcaster and female amazon. As in most of these RPGs, each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, personalities and motivations. You begin as the swordsman, a member of the guard of the Queen's army. Enemies are attacking and you head out to cleanse your land of the enemies. Soon enough you have all four party members on board, and are gaining experience, finding loot, and improving your skills, weapons and armor. Gameplay is very much like most other RPGs on the market. You have a large world that you explore bit by bit. When you get near enemies, you button-mash to create combos and earn experience. As you explore the lands, you bash urns and break into chests to steal the treasures of your villagers. While combat is fast and furious, the rest the game can be very slow paced. There are very long cut scenes in this game to draw you into the story. Be prepared with your favorite food and drink to keep yourself busy while these scenes drag on. The people you speak to each have one or two key phrases and simply repeat them over and over again. The graphics are very nice in a Final Fantasy sort of way - a detailed, cartooney fantasy world of big castles and peaceful villages. On the other hand, you're sort of moving from 'painting' to 'painting' much of the time, which can be frustrating and feel like you're being led by the nose through the plot. On the true downside, the female characters appear to enjoy wearing the skimpiest of bikinis into brutal combat with a lot of blood and gore. This earns the game its mature rating. It's certainly great to have female party members in a game - it wasn't very long ago that adventure games solely featured male characters. But do they have to all look like prostitues?? The sound is reasonably nice, with music that helps to convey the feeling of the scenes. In general, the game is a fun introduction to how RPGs work, but with the game being so linear, there isn't much decision making in the game. And with the game only lasting maybe a week or two of average game playing time, it is over very quickly. So those who would best benefit from this type of 'intro' RPG - i.e. young kids and tweens - can't buy it because of its mature rating. If I were the maker, I would have toned back the blood and skin to earn the game a more kid-friendly rating, which would have made the game well suited to its target audience. As it is, only adults who are just learning about RPGs will really appreciate what this game has to offer. The rest of us will zip through it pretty quickly and be left wanting something a bit more meaty.</td><td>Too Short, Too Gory for target audience</td><td>1103932800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>33531</td><td>4.0</td><td>70</td><td>false</td><td>12 25, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000663U5</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>This computer game is based on the popular TV series. The gameplay does a good job of having you feel like you're in an exciting episode of the show. The characters and voices are right from the TV show, so you really feel like you're part of the action. You head out to the crime scene - a woman was killed while jogging in Central Park. You search the scene for evidence, and then start talking to various suspects. You can choose your strengths, so you can know which questions not to ask, or you can get help finding evidence by having them highlighted. You have your crime lab and research lab examine evidence, and your surveillance team watches the people. As you find more clues, you track down more people to talk to. Get enough evidence, and you can request a search warrant, and eventually accuse someone of the crime. That's when things get turned over to the lawyers. Now you try to prosecute this criminal, calling witnesses, discussing evidence, objecting to bad questioning. If you do a good enough job, you can nail the perpetrator! The game definitely draws you along, You eagerly await the results of the tests you request, and wonder what the people you are talking to are hiding. You have an inkling of what you are looking for, and dig around until you track it down. On the downside, the game is extremely single-threaded. The only way you can talk to person X is to investigate item Y - but you have no idea that it's item Y you need to submit out of the 50+ items you find at the scene. You can't carry them all, and you get scolded for picking up each item or submitting too many to evaluate. Where in a normal crime scene you'd figure the crew would gather up all evidence and sift it for you, here you get deducted moments for each \"thing\" on the ground (you don't know what it is until you pick it up) you even look at! So it almost forces you to play each half of the game many times - a few times to figure out what all the items *are* and which are important, and then a last time to actually just touch the items you now know \"by osmosis\" are important to your case. The same is true during questioning of various people - questions that seem to be quite related end up causing the person not to answer questions that you actually need. They randomly decide at a point not to talk to you further - even if you have more questions for them. For example, a cleaner has his cart parked on a key point of evidence. But ask him the wrong questions and you cannot ask him to move his cart, even though he's still standing right there! Finally, even though I use my system for many, many games of all types, this one crashed on me very frequently. It just meant even more frequent saves and restores, beyond what the gameplay already forced on you through its single-mindedness. Recommended to a fan of the show, and a great concept. Hopefully future releases will address some of these issues and give the game more open gameplay, as in real world detecting.</td><td>A great idea but some flaws in implementation</td><td>1040774400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>home</td><td>1475109</td><td>1.0</td><td>21</td><td>false</td><td>12 24, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B001EYILAW</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I was very enthused to try the Bissell 7350 out. I have always adored carpet cleaners and greatly treasure their usefulness. We have between 2-4 cats and we both work from our home, so the quality of our air is very important to us. We have tried out many carpet cleaners over the years, from several manufacturers, with varying levels of success. The one we use currently is the Bissell ProHeat Select 9400M, so a similar shaped model but with actual brushes on the front instead of this \"paint roller\" gadget. I was curious to see how this 7350 compared with our ProHeat. We assembled the 7350 very quickly and set it up to give it a try. First we thoroughly vacuumed the carpet - a nice, low berber carpet, ideal (one would think) for use with this non-scrubby system. After the vacuuming we thoroughly went over the carpet with the 7350. The water that came up was only the mildest color. There was pretty much no \"dirt\" or such in the resulting liquid. Stains on the carpet seemed completely untouched. Then I waited a day so that the carpet could dry thoroughly - and I went over the exact same carpet with our regular Bissell ProHeat. The water came up VERY dark with a lot of dirt in it. It was clear that the 7350 had done nothing at all on the carpet. Even the second pass with the ProHeat - with water only - brought up a darker color water than the Bissell 7350 had done on its very first pass. Remember, this was on a low carpet. The \"paint roller\" front couldn't get into that low carpet to get the dirt out. If someone was using this on a thicker carpet, I doubt it would do much of anything at all. We then tried the 7350 on our linoleum kitchen floor. The thought being that the floor was nice and flat and the paint roller front might have at least half a chance cleaning that surface. The 7350 did actually do reasonably well on the floor, taking up some light mud but failing if the mud was anything clingy. Also, because it is so \"high\" as a unit it doesn't fit underneath the standard overhang of the cabinet bottoms, so you would have to do all of those lower areas by hand. These are areas our Scooba fits into very nicely without any issue. As bad as this all was, it really wasn't the worst part. The worst part was by far the noise. We have a Scooba and Roomba which we love, and those are about 80db. Our BissellProHeat is louder, at about 90db. However, this Bissell 7350 is not only an ear-shattering 110db but has a high pitched shriek to it which is nasty. Anyone who uses this in their home should not only be wearing ear protection but ensure that any young kids or pets are far away. Their ears are far more sensitive to damage than adults' ears are. There's also a leakage problem with the tank, but really in the end that is the least of your worries. And while it has a \"power wheel driver\" which is supposed to make it easier to push, Instead, it yanks the unit out of your hand at too quick a pace, meaning you actually have to \"pull back\" on the 7350 so that it goes at a good, slow pace to clean the carpet. It makes it hard to control what you are doing. In fact, in playing with the unit it doesn't seem like it even actually \"vacuums\" the carpet. What it seems to do is spray water onto the roller - then roll the soft, wet paint roller over the carpet to \"mop at it\" like you might do with a wet towel. Then it vacuums the *paint roller* to get the water or dirt off the roller that might have gotten picked up on its pass. Which pretty much explains why it can't get in-deep dirt or do much at all. Add onto all of this that you are supposed to replace the roller every six months - probably having to buy a special item directly from them. So if they stop making that roller, you're out of luck. Also, because you pre-mix the solution into the water from the beginning, you can't do a \"rinse pass\" as you do with other units. You can only do a soapy pass and then hope you've gotten it all up. I would definitely NOT recommend buying this unit. I would recommend their ProHeat 9400M as being awesome, and it is really odd to me that the same manufacturer came out with two such different ends of the spectrum. I can't even think of who I would give this to, between it working so poorly and its eardrum-damaging noise.</td><td>I'm surprised this is from Bissell</td><td>1230076800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>home</td><td>229230</td><td>5.0</td><td>95</td><td>false</td><td>12 24, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000TI5DK</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I love having very simple holiday decorations that are also very meaningful. One of the most powerful images to me is of a home nestled in the thick snows of winter, with candles in each window to help guide a lonely traveler in to his place of rest. This is a tradition that dates back thousands of years and is just as touching in modern times. The Good Tidings LED candles with sensors are brilliant for many reasons. First, they use LED lights which means they are NOT hot to the touch, they are safely cool. They also burn for weeks and weeks without burning out. I love LED lights as being amazingly energy efficient. They run on batteries meaning there are no dangerous cables to trip on or to catch fire. They safely sit on your windowsill, providing that soft candle-like glow, doing their job for travelers and people who drive by the house, all in perfect safety. I love the color of the flame. It is a natural golden orange color. A few people have said they would prefer a pure-white flame. I'm not sure what types of candles people are burning in their homes to get white flames - that would scare me! We have a fireplace here and the fireplace's fire is orange. That is the color of fire :) I find that orange golden glow to be exactly natural looking and again it connects me with the thousands of years where people did have wax candles in their windows to help their loved ones return home safely. Finally, the sensor aspect of these candles is simply brilliant. I put them into my windows and that's it. They turn on at dusk, they turn off at dawn. I leave the house in the daytime, and when I come home at night those candles are all lit, guiding me home, welcoming me. It is a wonderful feeling.

If you've seen Saving Private Ryan, you know what you're in for. Head-throbbing noise and death all around you. The game goes for instant immersion. You're barely off on your first trip when shells are landing, guns are hammering in your ears and there is complete chaos. You have to be careful not to hit a friendly while you're blasting away at the bad guys.  You can barely see what you're doing. Your friends drag you along when you're hurt, and the rain and smoke can blind you. Call of Duty 3 does a great job of giving you a WWII environment with character. You're in destroyed homes with cans on the shelves and holes blown into bedroom walls. You can see the smoke drifting across the main street, the plunks of rain as it falls through the boards. Bodies collapse realistically. The PS3's high def graphics really shine here. The controller also adds to the sense of immersion. When you want to whap someone in the head with your gun, you just give the controller a sharp twist. You also use the controller for other steering-related tasks as well. How about the sound? Playing the Call of Duty series always gives me a headache after a while :) But that's the point - war wasn't fun. It's not about cool pop soundtracks while you blow away the enemies. It's about listening carefully for footsteps in the silence, and then having your eardrums shatter when the barrage rains down on you. Gameplay is well done with multi-pathed missions that let you choose your objective, within the current mission's parameters. You can't just decide to turn around and head for Bermuda :).  Your leaders tell you what your group needs to do - but then it's up to you how to get it done. Even if you're an uber-soldier and whip through the main gameplay in a short period of time, there is still the online side, which can keep you going for *months*. The in-game play is only training for the real challenge, live human opponents.  Of course, if you don't like online gameplay, there is certainly a wealth of gameplay to replay for quite a while before you start to get bored.

We all want it to be simple. Are there secrets we can get from a book? Hurrah, talk about easy! This book combines those human desires with another one - the need for silly trivia. This bathroom-perfect-book has 100 different bizarre studies, telling you that 64% of people who felt they failed felt it was someone else's fault. 70% of successful long term managers focus on an even keel in daily life, rather than focussing on highs and lows. 90% of people feel they'll someday hit their career goals. Each of the studies is accompanied by a little blurb that sometimes relates to the study - and sometimes does not. You also get a short illustrative story featuring a person who comes to an insight about their job or life. None of the items here are life changing ideas. They're all common sense, and some of them are quite silly. You learn that it might get worse before it gets better - so stick with it. On the other hand, maybe you should reevaluate your goals and decide on new, better ones. Who knows which is the better course. After all, your goals are a living thing. Be sure to find your own path - but don't want everything - just the things that you should want. Write down the directions too - in case someone else is following along behind you and wants to follow your path, towards your goal. Which is changing. I don't mean to tease this book too much. I did enjoy it. It had nice little thoughts in it that certainly were good to think about. They are like zen koans, things to think about and ponder. Maybe each morning you wake up you could flip the book to a random page, read its message, and then see how it applies to your life. Like exercise and eat right. That sounds like a good one that could apply to every day. So could hope springs eternal. Then again, you could go to a website that gives you a random feel-good idea each day, and accomplish pretty much the same thing.

You get quick games, planned out career mode, plus live play and minigames. First, the characters you can play. By default you are Tiger Woods of course, but you can also play Vijay Singh, Mike Weir, Chris DiMarco, tons more, or create your own character from scratch. The creation screen is rather impressive, so you can really create a golfer that you can relate to. We had a ton of fun playing with the precise level of detail. Unibrow? Freckle density? It's all here. You start out with six extremely detailed courses - but EA lists the following courses as the ones supported for this version of the game. I imagine that it means the rest of the courses will be able to be downloaded in the future. You can only fit so much information on one DVD! I've marked which ones come on the game DVD. Bethpage Black Carnoustie - INCLUDED Central Park Cog Hill Doral Greek Isles Kapalua Pasatiempo Pebble Beach - INCLUDED Pinehurst #2 - INCLUDED Pumpkin Ridge Red Rock Creek Reflection Bay Riviera - INCLUDED Sahalee St Andrews Troon North - Pinnacle TPC at Sawgrass - INCLUDED Turnberry - INCLUDED The game is definitely not an \"arcade\" easy style button masher. There's no swing-o-meter to hit the X button on. You have to really \"swing\" the joystick properly to hit your shot. I found this really natural to do, and my boyfriend, who is an avid golfer, was playing extremely well in only a few holes. That being said, if you're not into golf and don't understand the club choices / ground slope issues, you can have problems. I really loved how the power shots go into slow motion if you hit them right on, and how the crowd roars out its approval for the great shots. It really gives you a visceral sense of reward. I also love how the crowd cringes if your shot goes too near them, or they actually double over in pain when you hit them. I admit to aiming for them a few times :) It was just too funny. The graphics are quite nice. The shadows ripple across the green, the ball kicks up debris, the clouds roll across the sky. The birds chirp, you can hear the wind rustling in the trees. The characters still aren't quite photorealistic, but we're getting quite close. I remember as a kid playing the Atari Golf with little pixel-characters - this is amazing how far we've come. The sounds really draw you in, from the commentary to the crowd noises to the ambient sounds. I didn't even mind the background rock music in the character screens and such. There's a ton of items to unlock - better clubs, better shafts, and so on. There are always new challenges to try for and items to strive for. For quick arcadey fun, we're big fans of the PSP Hot Shots Golf, and we finished that game all the way through. But for a serious challenge, where our golf skills are tested and honed, we really like this one. It's both very challenging and very relaxing at the same time. If I was going to pick on the game, perhaps I'd say it was too hard for beginners, or those who don't really play golf. However, there are tons of games out there that are deliberately arcadey or just \"fun\". Casual players have plenty of options to choose from already. If someone is a serious golfer looking for a game to have fun with during rainy days and winter season, I really recommend this one.</td><td>Great realism for the serious golfer</td><td>1135382400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>94344</td><td>4.0</td><td>9</td><td>false</td><td>12 23, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000JHO4CO</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 for the PS3 really helps to show how far golf games have come. The motions are fluid, the characters realistic, and the gameplay is fun. First, the gameplay. That's always what matters most in a sports game. We've been playing a lot of Wii sports games and are really impressed with being able to swing the controller like a golf club, which is very \"natural\". That being said, they did a great job here with what they had available. Rather than using a \"power bar\" like some golf games, you simply watch the golfer on the screen, and judge by his actual swing. This means you have to have some knowledge about the real game of golf, to know how much a golfer *should* swing. However, it also means that this doesn't turn into an arcadey button-pushing exercise. You're actually paying attention to the swing and proper form. On the other hand, once the ball goes up into the air, you can press buttons to affect its flight - including once it lands. I find this a little cheap myself, as if you have a remote control and are moving the ball around. I realize that it'd be a lot to ask a player to do, to control the swing speed, angle, backspin, etc. while they are swinging - but again that would be realistic. So with one hand they giveth, and with the other they taketh away. There are the standard styles of gameplay here - match play, best ball, as well as a range of fun mini-games. I really like how they handled the tutorials, allowing you to jump in and out of them as you need to. They even let you read them, watch them, or just try them, based on your individual style. There are different levels of difficulty, so you can let your kid play in easy mode to learn the game, while the experienced golfers can tune their gameplay with a more difficult challenge. The graphics are rather impressive for a just-after-launch title for a new console. You don't expect those releases to be able to fully utilize what the PS3 offers, but they did well here. Tiger Woods himself looks very realistic and impressive; his movements are quite smooth. You can see individual blades of grass on the greens. The water is a little odd, and the trees are a little pixelly, but I'm sure when '08 comes out they'll nail some of those smaller details. The key thing with golf is mainly that you can see the fairway, and then read the greens. You don't really pay attention to the details on the audience's faces. I do like how they handle the greens in this game vs in other golf games. The combinations of grids, lines and colors give you a good sense of each area of the green. There are even nice details like shadows of clouds drifting by and reflections in objects. Does anybody really listen to sound in a golf game? You get the roaring of the ocean, the chirping of birds, and the inane chatter of the commentary folks. Some of their statements made me laugh out loud. You can choose various songs if you're playing with a soundtrack. If you're a golfer with a PS3, this is definitely the game to get. If you've got other systems, it'll depend if you like the motion-sensing capabilities of the Wii enough to offset the lower graphics on that system ... or the motion-twisting PS3 controller vs the 360.</td><td>Great Fun - Regular Golf plus Mini-Games</td><td>1166832000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>35470</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>12 23, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000069BCR</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Hitman 2 is a first person shooter which rewards control and stealth over full-out blasting. Gorgeous graphics and freeform gameplay make this great for teenagers and adults. To start out, you're a retired hitman, enjoying the beauty, peace, and serenity of Sicily, Italy. You talk with your friend, the priest, about your hope for being one with God. Unfortunately for you, this is when the bad guys show up and kidnap the priest. You don't have the $500,000 ransom they demand, so you call up your agency and arrange to do some missions for them in return for help rescuing the priest. And you're off! You're wandering through very well done maps, with a diverse collection of tools at your disposal. Do you pick the locks to go in the back way? Shoot the guy from the trees, sneak up and wire him, maybe chloroform him in a corner? The game is very open-pathed. You choose which way to approach a mission, what might work best. Your opponents are smart and react to finding bodies or to unusual behavior. This isn't a go-here-then-go-there game, it's a game where you're placed in the world and have to decide which approach works best for you. There's a stealth meter, you can hear your footsteps, you can see your shadow. Having just finished playing Splinter Cell, though, the game suffers a bit in comparison. The movements are more jerky, the lighting quality not nearly as good. You can peer through keyholes, but not around a partially opened door, or shoot around the door. You can't move along walls and peer around the corner. So some stealth techniques we found quite natural and helpful from Spliter Cell were impossible here. Also, the open-endedness of the missions can lead to frustration. Even taking one step two far or opening the wrong door can lead to mission failures, so you can spend hours on a single mission trying to figure out which technique will work. In essence you learn what each AI character does and then work around it - which isn't very realistic. Still, the game is quite fun to play, the graphics are very nice, and the missions are interested.

This lets you actually tilt your GBA unit to play the game. This game is designed to be easy and fun for the younger set, so more advanced players might find it a bit too easy or dull. You are Yoshi, whose island has been trapped in pages of a book. Your only way to free the island is to go from page to page, pleasing the spirits in each section so they help you free your island. Really what this means is that you have to move left to right (or sometimes top to bottom) along a one-way track, avoiding enemies, gathering coins, eating fruit, or performing whatever other actions are required to move along. For example, in one area the \"baby eggs\" that once lived there in happy harmony have now been turned into red fruits. You have to eat each one and fart out the original egg. I'm not exactly sure how this works in the digestive system, but Nintendo has always played a bit fast and loose with this sort of thing :) You can even see which eggs you've freed over time, in a gallery area. By tilting the GBA unit left and right, sort of like spinning a lazy susan clockwise or counterclockwise, you help Yoshi move along. You swing wrecking balls, let Yoshi slide down snowy slopes, roll slowballs into larger and larger sizes, and even ride on half-pipes. None of the puzzles are really challenging, but again this is meant for kids. The puzzles are all ones that a kid can figure out relatively easily and then have a lot of fun playing through.

I'm saying this because we were in utter shock that the game is so short, so boring, and so completely unlike the previous games that we loved. I can't even imagine how the company that created the previous, fantastic Gauntlet games could be responsible for this release. Maybe they lost their good programmers and were under contract to release a new Gauntlet by X date, so they had their newbie coders kick this out? I am just horrified at how poor this game was. First, you get a choice of four charaters, of course - the elf, warrior, mage or valkyrie. However, you don't get to choose their color! I know it's a small thing, but I was ticked at that to start. Your character has 3 main attacks plus 1 long-range attack - so the elf gets 3 sword swings plus his bow attack. In addition, there are combo attacks and d-button super attacks that you can pay to unlock over time. You then move from map to map, bashing away at enemies, killing the enemy generators and finding keys for doors. That part of the gameplay is similar to previous games. You can't shoot your friends in the back of the head, which my fellow gamers appreciated greatly. I was notorious for standing in the back area as the elf and just letting the arrows fly. Really, the huge issue is the game's shortness. If it was 3-4 times longer, at least, it would seem perhaps worth playing. But I really found its entire layout much less interesting than the previous Gauntlet. In the previous one, you had a central area from where you could go out to various worlds, each with its own theme, going back and forth as you wished. In this one it's just a straight line, and while there are some thematic elements, it came across as a dungeon crawl that just plodding on for a few hours, then stopped. Also, in the previous games, when you got character upgrades it was really exciting. You clearly saw the change and it was something fun to pay attention to. In this one when you get weapon and armor upgrades, you can barely tell. We would even stare at our characters before doing an upgrade, and it was hard to see anything had even changed. The vocals really didn't impress me much. Part of the problem is that they would tell you \"elf needs food\" when the elf still had a ways to go - but then they would tell you \"starving\" and \"has died\" right on top of each other. So you were always being harassed about needing food, but never when you really needed to know. Also, with death being able to be slain with a mana blast, you pretty much were able to kill off death in .2 seconds any time you opened a chest. So Death was barely announcing his presence before he vanished again. The graphics were good. There were many spots that looked walkable that you were magically blocked from going into, which was a bit annoying. If an area isn't open, don't put a wide open door pointing to it :) I just don't know what went wrong here. I am extremely disappointed. Be sure to rent this game first, to see if it's something you would enjoy more than a day or two.</td><td>A big letdown for a huge Gauntlet fan</td><td>1135209600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>71903</td><td>4.0</td><td>20</td><td>false</td><td>12 22, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000A8NXCO</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Devil Kings is a Dynasty Warriors style game where you choose a main character, start on a map, and plow your way through literally thousands of enemies. The game is set in feudal Japan, but in a bizarre twist, they decided to \"rename\" every single Japanese historical character to have a made-up name. In the original Japanese version of the game you get the real characters. In the US game, we have to play with \"dragons\", \"minotaurs\" and \"devil kings\". Why? Do they think a historical game with cool characters would be too boring for us US folk? Playable Characters: Azure Dragon is Date Masamune Scorpio is Sanada Yukimura Devil King is Oda Nobunaga Lady Butterfly is Nouhime Frost is Kenshin Uesugi Red Minotaur is Shingen Takeda Puff is Itsuki Q-ball is Zabi Hornet is Mori Ranmaru Venus is Kasuga Talon is Sarutobi Sasuke Iron Ox is Honda Tadakatsu Non Playable Characters: Zaan is Shimasu Yoshihiro Lark is Maeda Toshiie Bramble is Matsu Reaper is Akechi Mitsuhide Irdene is Ieyasu Tokugawa Arslan is Shosokabe Motochiga Orwik is Hojo Fujimasa Kahz is Mori Motonari Muri is Imagawa Yoshitomo In any case, you start out with a few of the characters and unlock more as you go. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, and you really do find favorites that match your personal gameplay style best. Gameplay in general involves wading into giant groups of enemies, swinging with massive combo strikes, and taking them all out at once. Instead of authentic feudal Japanese music, you get a rock music track, just like in Dynasty Warriors. I suppose if they had to turn the people into mythological monsters, there was little chance of authentic sounds :) The vocals are reasonably good, and there isn't much to \"sound effect\" here besides CHING! and BASH! The graphics are rather good, with a very long range of the battlefield and hundreds of enemies massing against you at once. Characters in the background often look like they're actually \"awake and active\" many times, as compared to Dynasty Warriors where the enemies often seemed to be hanging around chatting until you reached them. There are even special, reasonably long anime sequences that are quite nicely done. They are triggered at different times during the game and help to move the story along. The combat system does have many cool features. You can pre-weaken people sometimes with certain powers, or hook up your fury gauge to build up your super attack. In general, though, this is a lay-back-and-have fun button masher that gives you a GREAT sense of achievement as you see the bodies flying and the counter ratchet up. This isn't a stealth planning game, or a long term strategy game. It's a fun game that you can pick up the controller when you've got an hour, bash through a few levels, then save and go off to whatever else you want to do. The gameplay itself does move from feudal Japan into fantasty rather quickly. There are robots, Egyptians, shotguns and double-hand-shooting going on. This isn't just a game of swords and armor. In general, we found this quite a lot of fun to play!</td><td>Feudal Japan meets Mythology</td><td>1135209600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>252489</td><td>3.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>12 21, 2012</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0058VI1SO</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Birds of Steel is a plane flying game set in the Pacific arena of World War II. They have modeled a vast number of planes and offer a quite challenging realistic mode. We adore flight games and have played most that have come out. We were really looking forward to this one. Those used to arcade style flight games where you can bounce along the runway might need some patience here. You do get a set of instructional missions. After that, the game expects you to learn how to fly a plane. Even the most easy mode still requires you to master a few basics. If you kick it up to the more realistic modes, expect to learn skills that real pilots have to know. You get a range of missions set in realistic scenarios. You're at Pearl Harbor as well as a number of other locations. You're zipping through clouds, screaming across the treeline, and dodging to avoid a barrage of bullets. You can play both as the Japanese and American side. You basically fly three or four planes through the missions. They do also offer head to head options where you could mix things up. The graphics are pretty poor. It feels like a game from 3-4 years ago, not a recent release. The controls are a bit challenging as well. Your throttle is on the same stick as your turning - so turning without affecting your throttle can be rough. A typical mission is to take off, fly to join your group of 3-4 friends, go to your destination, deal with the task, then return and land. You get points for each stage, so for example you get points for taking off. You also get load screens along the way. So you're in the sky, hitting Objective A, and then you have to wait through a long load screen before you \"pop over\" to somewhere else. It seems unnecessary in a modern world where you could just keep flying smoothly to keep you in the game atmosphere. The differences between the various modes are *massive*. You can't easily ramp up through them. So an OK game in terms of its scenarios, but the quite long loading screens, the controls, and the large jumps between difficulty levels prevent this from earning top marks.

There are two characters that you go back and forth playing, one being a Night's Watch brother and the other being a Red Priest.  You get some small amount of configuration - for each you can choose one of three basic battle techniques. These then affect your \"attack tree\" for building experience. The priest gets magic, and the fighter gets a dog to take over with. You find various items along the way of your quests, mostly junk you just sell, but occasionally you do hit a useful item. There's an arena mini-game to hone your battle skills, and you bet on them as well. You can even bet against yourself and throw a fight. You do get some decisions along the way, and they affect how certain characters react to you later on. Gameplay is frustrating. The game will auto-save when you head into a section, and if it's long and convoluted, you're sent all the way back to that spot. This issue then trains you to have to save after every single action which is tedious. Loading times are quite slow as well. By the end of the game it seemed like one was doing the same thing over and over again. Graphics and sound were OK. Not stunning, but not atrocious either. All in all, the game was not so awful that we gave up part way through, but it didn't leave us thrilled with the experience when we finished. It could have been so much more. The bar was set high by the novel and the actors in the series. The game doesn't rise up to those standards.

It offers HD video and can still play old-style Wii games as well. I played and tested with our Wii U for a full month before posting this review. I wanted to make sure that the console behaved well throughout that time, and that we could get past any normal breaking-in highs and lows that tend to come with new consoles. The console definitely is update-heavy. There have been several times that we've turned it on and had to sit through 20 minutes of fresh updates before playing a game. So it's important, when you first get it, to set aside time for doing those system updates. You can't always just turn-on-and-play. If you're planning to set aside an hour of gaming after dinner, it's a good idea to check the unit BEFORE dinner so you can update during dinner if necessary. The video quality is now on par with the XBox 360 and PS3. The old Wii had always gone with the \"poor-video-but-cheap\" mantra, which certainly worked for a while. However in our modern world where many people have HD TVs, it became a bit rough after a while. On the down side, the old Wii could play GameCube games. This new one cannot. So if you still have GameCube games lying around, you'll have to keep a separate system to play them. Speaking of things the WiiU can't do, it can't play any video DVDs - either standard or BluRay. That seems quite a shame. Half of what we use our PS3 for is playing movies. So again something to know. If you have a WiiU you'll still need a DVD player for your video watching. I definitely recommend you get the 32 GIG unit. It fills up quickly. Our set came with an included copy of NintendoLand - I'll review that separately. Suffice to say it had some fun mini-games and some less than fun ones, as most compilation sets do. The console comes with the special WiiU tablet but NOT any normal WiiMotes which you definitely will want. So make sure you get your hands on one or more WiiMotes. The old ones that went with the Wii work perfectly fine. The WiiU tablet is quite fun. It's an entirely separate screen and with some games you can play the WiiU games on it for times that someone else wants to watch the main TV. For many games you use that tablet as a secondary screen. For example in Zombie U you use the tablet to manage your inventory and map. In Super Mario a second player can \"build blocks\" for the main player to step on. In some of the NintendoLand games one player uses the screen while other players watch the main screen. This makes it especially fun to play \"hiding\" games like the ghost hunter one, because the ghost really can hide. He can see where he is on the tiny screen, and the others looking at the main screen have no idea. Like any other console purchase, much of it comes down to how you personally will use the console and what type of games you play. If you want an all-in-one console that also handles media center types of activities, the PS3 might be better for you. If you love the Super Mario series, that's only on the Wii. If you already had a Wii and had GameCube games, know that you'll lose access to those GameCube games. If you adore the Wii, love the Just Dance games on it and are OK with it just being a gaming machine, you'll probably love the extra quality graphics and extra features of the Wii U. We have both the normal Wii and the Wii U, as well as an XBox 360 and PS3. We use each of them for different types of activities. In terms of the Wii U, we do enjoy greatly the use of the tablet with games, especially multiplayer games. I think the tablet will be a big factor in upcoming games, and I'll be curious to see if the other systems begin to push hard in this direction as well. I'd suggest you think twice if you could only have one, single console and you wanted to be able to watch movies on it. Or if you really wanted to play GameCube games on your console. In those cases, other consoles might fit your needs better. Well recommended.

When I first saw the DS Lite at E3 in 2006, I was thrilled. The game great handheld unit design - but lighter! Brighter! Tuned! It really showed that Nintendo had been paying attention to customer feedback during those two years, and had tweaked its unit to be even better than before. First, the weight. We always *loved* the design of the DS, with its folding top. As PSP owners, I can't tell you how many time that poor PSP screen gets dinged or scratched. We had to buy extra carrying cases for our PSP and get screen protectors. In comparison, the DS's clamshell design means the screen is perfectly protected when you tote it around in your pocket or purse. The only down-side was that it was a bit heavy. With the DS lite, they keep the protection of the clamshell and also lighten up the unit significantly. It really does help a lot. The screen brightness - with it being *adjustable* - is an incredibly helpful update. Sometimes you're playing outside in very bright light. Sometimes you're playing in full dark, staying awake in bed. There are all levels in between. If you need that brightness, you don't care if you're burning up your battery power. If you do NOT need that brightness, why kill your battery for no reason? Having that ability to adjust really means that your battery works as best as it possibly can. We play several games that use the microphone, like Brain Age, and it definitely helps to have it in the center. Usually you're holding the unit with both hands, centered on your face. To have your mouth pointed right at the microphone helps out greatly with those games. In general the DS system is a fantastic handheld gaming system. We have both the DS and PSP and we play both frequently. Many of the games on the DS aren't available on the PSP and are a ton of fun. The Brain Age / Big Brain Academy / similar games stand out as games we enjoy daily. There are many other games that use the DS touch screen extremely well, giving a full interactivity of gameplay. Yes, the PSP has better graphics. It's something that the DS compromised on. They have less detailed graphics, but more interactivity. Both are great for the games they offer. So for example we play flight simulator style games on our PSP, where the high end graphics matter, and we play puzzle / platform / thinking games on the DS, where the interactivity and plot is more key. I highly recommend the DS Lite for anybody who doesn't have a DS yet - whether you have a PSP or not. It's not an either-or situation. It's like having a stereo and a TV set. They're both great for their own reasons, and most people would enjoy having both. If you HAVE a Nintendo DS already and are wondering if you should get a Lite, it really depends on how much you use it away from home. The primary benefit here is the lighter carrying weight, smaller size and much better battery life. If you're carrying it in your pocket, purse or backpack every day, I would really recommend getting a Lite.

The landscape of True Crime, set in Los Angeles, is a full 250 square miles. That's 10 times bigger than Vice City! Unlike the GTA series, this time you're on the side of the good guys. You are Nick Kang, an Asian-American who is part of an elite cop unit. You're a rough and tumble police officer who can easily shoot, fight or drive his way out of any situation. The 'fake' maps of the GTA series and the 'real' map of London in the Getaway were mere training grounds for the HUGE map of Los Angeles and all its suburbs. Drive from Santa Monica into Hollywood, grabbing up to 50 different types of cars along the way. You're not carjacking them - you're commandeering them for police activities. You have a good/bad rating and are penalized if you take out too many innocents in your quest to get the bad guys. You can find training centers to improve your skills, and take on a variety of missions. I liked this game MUCH more than the Getaway in that sense - instead of being stuck on missions in a single thread, you have much more freedom of exploring the city and deciding what to do next. The navigation is also great. The streets actually have SIGNS on them - what a concept! You also are told on-screen where you are both in suburb, a mini-map and a street sign indicator. It always drove me crazy in The Getaway that a guy who LIVES in this town wouldn't even know where he was. True Crime handles that issue quite nicely. The graphics on the XBox are extremely impressive. Car windows reflect light and can be shattered. When you run into a sign, it crumples. There are tattoo shops and fancy botiques along the streets. And even on the massive scale they cover, the trees have branches and the Japanese sports cars have legible kanji on the back. I didn't like the default set of music - I was much more impressed with the GTA3/Vice City radio station selection which was just AMAZINGLY fun. But on the up side, the XBox lets you load your hard drive full of music and play it randomly. Build your own radio stations and enjoy them! There are a good selection of sub-missions from hand-to-hand fighting, to shoot-outs, to car chases, to secret tails, to stealth infiltration and much more. There are slow-mo bullet time attacks, a fun sense of humor and destructable objects in your environments. On the down side, the game does get a little ... bizarre ... near the end, but I'll let you find that twist out for yourself.

I had high hopes for this game, but it seems a bit outdated. You start out with some simple target practice - balloons, bombers and barrels. Soon you're moving against a variety of targets in the air, land and sea. There are 30 missions in all, plus the option for multiplayer combat. I've always been a huge fan of flight simulators and space combat simulators. So I was all ready for this fresh release to have great graphics and gameplay. I just wasn't impressed at all in either case. Yes, I suppose if you compare the graphics against the early flight simulators, it's amazing how far we've come. The plane has the details of the flaps and wing segments, the landscape has trees and roads. The radar display sweeps around. But nothing is up to the standards of current day productions. The same is true for the planes themselves, how they fly and how the AI flies against you. Your plane's controls are extremely simplistic. Yes, you stall if you fly straight up, as you would expect to! And yes if you plow head-first into a structure you crash. But there are many other cases where the game plays more like an arcade version set on \"very easy\" than a modern day WW2 combat game. This might be a good game for someone who has never played flight simulators before and who wants a very simple entry into that area before dealing with something more complex. But any advanced gamer, or a gamer who has played any style of airplane / spacecraft flying game, will want to rent this one first to see how they personally enjoy what it offers.</td><td>A Good Trainer, Not Great as a Game</td><td>1071878400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>36932</td><td>5.0</td><td>86</td><td>false</td><td>12 2, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006F7RS</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is now a computer game that's out for the PC as well as PS2 and other platforms. While they could have sold millions even with an awful game, this one is pretty good. The game starts out with a reasonably good 3D model of Harry being rescued in a flying car by his friends. They fly back to Ron's house, where their mom promptly scolds them for their hijinks. They're sent out into the yard where Harry (i.e. you, the player) start to learn how to use your controls. You're shown how to use your want, how to gather up beans. You move along to degnoming the property, which is great fun! You have to knock over the gnome and then whirl and fling him as far as possible. You get Wizard cards, chocolate frogs, you play Quidditch, and try to earn house points. There's some button-pressing games which are quite fun, but there are also a lot of puzzles for you to reason through. While the game is one player, other people get involved in trying to figure out the riddles and offer advice. Even when the puzzles are figured out and the game is won, it's still a great deal of fun to go back and play again, to try to get an even better score. This is sure to be a hit with any Potter fans, and is great for all ages of gamer.</td><td>Great fun for any Potter fan</td><td>1038787200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>57670</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>12 19, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0002B90SA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Talk about a long title! The full name of this game is Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords. As you might guess, it's a game based on an early Star Wars timeline. We're about 4 thousand years before the events in the Star Wars movie series, when the sith (bad force users) and jedi (good force users) are battling it out for control. This game is 5 years after the first KOTOR game. You are of course one of these force users, choosing between good and evil. Much as in Fable, your choices affect the way you look - and the way your friends look as well. You begin by customizing your character. You can be male or female, and choose from being force based, saber based, or a balanced type of character. As you move through the game, you get pieces to build a light saber, increase your skills, build out the plot, and make choices that have sometimes unintended consequences. I enjoy the KOTOR series because, since it's so far in the past, you don't start with a preconceived notion of what \"should\" happen. You have the fun universe of Star Wars to enjoy, but without the extremely well defined plotline. The graphics are quite good - you have translucent objects, sparks and smoke from damaged items, and good detail on robots. The sound plays themes that are fully traditional Star Wars, with matching sounds for doors, robots, and other items. If you enjoyed the gameplay of KOTOR, you'll enjoy KOTOR II as it's pretty much exactly the same. In fact because of the plot progression I highly recommend playing KOTOR first, before buying and playing this one. That will fill you in on the characters and situations, many of which play a role in this sequel. That being said, I don't think KOTOR II is nearly as rich as the original. KOTOR gave you a great sense of accomplishment as you moved through the missions, and a sense of completion when you reached the end. If anything, KOTOR II seems more of a 'transition' to rush you along to a spot from which you can buy KOTOR III. I had the exact same issue with Halo II, so maybe it is a common failing. Still, it is very frustrating. Highly recommended as a member of the KOTOR world, but not necessarily a game to rush out and buy immediately.</td><td>Good Universe, A Few Flaws</td><td>1103414400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>3442</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 19, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00000K125</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Soul Calibur is the classic version of the arcade game, and is only available on the Dreamcast. For many, it's the main reason to buy a Dreamcast! You get a nice selection of characters, both male and female, young and old. If there's a complaint about the characters, it's that the females tend to have VERY skimpy outfits that mostly show off jiggly breasts and lots of underwear. The guys tend to have fully covered bodies. Something's not quite even here. There are a number of modes, between simple arcade mode, one on one combat, training demos, and more. As you play through the game you earn points, which let you unlock more secrets. It encourages you to go through the game as each character, learning their best moves and techniques. Each character has his or her own favorite weapons and combat style. As with all fighting games, you have to get used to the violence. The characters are bashing each other with some rather nasty moves - and it doesn't necessarily stop when one person is defeated. I've seen my character kicked to the ground, the game announce my defeat, and then the enemy throw in a final, gratuitous kick. It's very discouraging. The different levels are fun, with their atmosphere and backgrounds. The music is on the generic side and doesn't go themed with the world you're in, as more modern fighters tend to do. Also it is sometimes fairly easy to simply knock your opponent out of the ring and be done with it. Also, on the sounds angle, there are only a limited number of things that the announcer says. So if you play a given character through an 8 round series of fights, you are going to hear the same thing over and over again. That all being said, this is a true classic of a game and many people have become quite fond of the sequels. So if you're into inexpensive fighters, or if you're a Soul Calibur fan who wants to see where it all began, this is a must have!</td><td>Still fun after all these years</td><td>1103414400</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>22669</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 19, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00005BX7K</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>If you're looking for a true immersive experience in combat-ridden Vietnam of the late 60s, this mature title might fit the bill. You work your way through the conflicts in Vietnam, starting as a green rookie and learning skills and techniques as you go. There are squad blasting missions, sneaky missions, missions where you need to slay a certain person, and other missions where you just shoot everyone in sight. The graphics are reasonably good - trees have individual leaves, the helmets have sayings scrawled on them, bursts of blood come out from shots. The weapons and outfits are well done. The sound goes for realistic over arcady. You don't get fun bouncy soundtracks as you fight you rway through the jungle - instead you're surrounded by gunfire, the shouting of your commander's orders and the cries of the wounded. It does get a little repetitive, though, as you hear \"destroy that tunnel!\" for the 20th time in a row. There are booby traps and tunnels, napalm and death. You shoot women in the head, see hands blown off. In general this game really earns its mature rating. Heads burst like a balloon, and some of the mission situations are questionable. If I was a Vietnam Vet (or a Vietnamese person for that matter) I'd be pretty annoyed at the portrayal of what an 'average soldier' was like. If you're a shooter fan and are looking for lots of blood, and can disconnect the game with the history it's playing, then you might enjoy this. But if you're really a fan of the military and of realistic shooters, there are other games on the market that are better to spend your money on.</td><td>Lots of Blood - Bordering on Gratuitous</td><td>1103414400</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>16826</td><td>5.0</td><td>15</td><td>true</td><td>12 19, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00004U4R9</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>This is the third in the Spyro-the-dragon action game series, and it's definitely the best.

You're doing the regular save-the-dragons gameplay, but this time there are dragon eggs (150 of them) with cute little baby dragons inside. Yes, the entire game is sort of \"cute\", but don't let that put you off. It's really an amazing action game with lots to offer. There are over 30 stages in the game, each with its own themes and special areas. There are mini-games like skateboarding area which are as fun (if not more fun) than the normal gameplay. They've done a great job of balancing the game, so that it's always challenging but you're never stuck somewhere. The puzzles are fun to work through.

It was sort of inevitable that their attention would move on to Greece, one of our founding civiliations. Zeus follows in its predecessors footsteps, making it relatively simple to pick up on the basic idea. You plant your crops, build your industries, set up trade and shops and tax collectors. Add in some basic services - home maintenance, water, infirmaries. They've got, of course, Greek-themed things to build. The theater is a big draw, as are the gymnasiums and schools of philosophy. It's religion, though, where this game differs from the others. Instead of trying to balance your way through keeping all the gods happy, in most missions you are working towards bringing in a hero, or pleasing a certain god. And these gods are very personal! The first mission, for example, involves a hydra. You don't build up warriors to kill it - you biuld a temple to the hero Hercules, and once you make the town alluring enough, he appears and roams around, spouting heroisms. He goes and kills the Hydra for you, and all is well. The game has a series of tutorials for those who haven't played this type of sim before, but for those experienced in the others, diving into the first \"beginner\" mission isn't a walk in the park. Unlike some other games where the first missions boringly walk you through the same old crop maintenance, this starts you full bore into the game, with a very wide selection of buildings you can use and things to do. It gets more challenging from there. There are also various open play options, if you just want to create your own military adventure or build a city that stretches from coast to coast. In all, the game is not a huge change from its predecessors, but it's still quite fun!</td><td>Great game with a keen sense of humor</td><td>977184000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>95135</td><td>5.0</td><td>127</td><td>false</td><td>12 18, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000K1GZIU</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>If you are getting your hands on a PlayStation 3 and have any PS2 games that you used to play on a PlayStation 2, then it is really important to get your hands on this memory card adaptor. In essence the memory card adaptor is a little box that you can put your PS2 memory card into. A cable then plugs into the PS3's USB port. This is the only way to get the save games from your PS2 into your PS3 so you can then use them with your PS2 games. Almost every PS3 owner I have spoken with owns a PS2 and many PS2 games. They intend to keep playing those PS2 games on the PS3. This is especially true with epic PS2 games like Final Fantasy XII. There's no reason to start again from scratch! The memory card adaptor is rather cheap, and saves you weeks if not months of play time. The act of moving save games is really very easy. Simply put your PS2 memory card into the small unit. On the PS3 console, select the card. It asks you to give a name to the \"storage area\" on your PS3's hard drive. For my 8 memory cards, I just named those storage areas CARD1 - CARD8, so that they matched up with the cards. Then you hit a button, and wait about 2 minutes while the files are moved. Once they're on your PS3's hard drive, you're all set! You can view the save games, delete the ones you don't want any more, and use them to play with. Definitely a must-have for a PS3 owner who has any PS2 memory cards lying around - or who has friends who might visit with PS2 games and cards. Sure, the PS3 games are great - but there are a TON of PS2 games out there that are a lot of fun, too. This little device lets you take advantage of all that time you've already invested in the game.</td><td>Incredibly Useful for PS3 Owners who Had PS2s</td><td>1166400000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>13952</td><td>5.0</td><td>78</td><td>false</td><td>12 18, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00004SQPD</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>With all the hype about the PS3, Wii and XBox 360, take another look at the PS2. It has a huge library of games, a reliable system, and is inexpensive! The PS2, which launched in December 2001, uses DVDs as its storage medium, meaning the unit can double as a CD and DVD player. It is small, light for carrying around, and doesn't have the sound or heat problems that the 360 and PS3 have. It's extremely sturdy - we have two PS2s and haven't had any problems with either one. The graphics on the PS2 are very impressive, especially some of the later games where the game designers had years to learn how to take advantage of every last detail in the system's design. For a long while the XBox had a clear advantage with graphics, but with some of the recent releases, like Final Fantasy XIII, the cut scenes were just gorgeous. Speaking of Final Fantasy, with the PS2 you can play all games from the PS2 *and* PS1 series - meaning you can play every Final Fantasy game that is out. That alone could keep you occupied for months if not years. Guitar Hero is another fantasic game that is only on the PS2. The guitar controllers literally cannot plug into a PS3. Here's a pretty clear indicator of how good the PS2 system is. We've had the XBox 360 for a year, and got the Wii and PS3s right when they came out. Even so, we were still going back to our PS2 to play the games we had on it, rather than bother with moving our save games up to the PS3. The games were really that good. Sometimes it's not about high def super graphics. Sometimes it's about pure, fun gameplay. The PS2 has perfected that over the years, and there are numerous games on this system that have legions of fans. There's even a network port if you want to play online. Note that it doesn't have \"built in wireless\" - you have to plug a bridge or other wireless adaptor into the port to have it connect to your home wireless network. This is really easy to do, though, and I have full instructions if you need them.

The game store owner was raving about them. \"You'll never use one up!\" he said. Now we have eight ... it really goes to show how every time new technology opens up, developers immediately find a way to fill it up. First off, many games now take up massive amounts of save space. If you're playing a game like Final Fantasy, where you want to save every 1/2 hr to hour just in case you get yourself stuck and need to go back to build up your characters, you use up memory card space quickly. Believe me, I'd much rather spend a few extra dollars on memory card space, vs wasting weeks of frustrating time having to replay entire games to get past a difficult boss. It's also critical, if you have more than one gamer in the family, to have separate memory cards. I can't tell you how many people email me at my gaming sites, wondering if they can \"recover\" lost save data because someone else accidentially overwrote or erased their save game. If it's a game you just started playing it's not so bad - but if you had been building your characters up over months, and had just about solved the entire epic game, it can be heart wrenching. These memory cards work for all PS2 games. If you get yourself a PS3, then you definitely will want to also get the PS2 - PS3 memory adapter. This little unit lets you plug your PS2 card into it, then a USB connector plugs into the PS3 so that the save games all read right into your PS3. Now you can play all your PS2 games on your PS3 without having to start from scratch. Note that your PS3 does NOT natively let you \"stick the PS2 memory card into it\". There is no slot on the PS3 for the PS2 card. Also, for games that you play for multiple weeks, I definitely recommend having a memory card backup of your current save games. Memory cards get lost, they get \"borrowed\" by accident, they do lose data occasionally if you step on them or drop them in the snow. Just like you back up your computer's hard drive occasionally, back up those important game save files. It only takes a few minutes and can save you months of replaying.

Here is our review of how it performs compared with our Wii and PS3. First, if you're going for an XBox 360, make sure you're getting a unit with a hard drive, and get a wireless controller. The hard drive lets you download updates for your games, add your own music to soundtracks, save as many save files as you want, and do a number of XBox Live functions. They even now offer tv shows and movies to download. Believe me - you're only getting 20 gig, and it'll fill up quickly! You want to have that hard drive. Most importantly, you can NOT play any old XBox (original) games if you don't have the hard drive. That is because the old games have to be 'converted' by software on the hard drive to be able to play in your new system. Not that not all games play on the 360 - but the most popular ones do. Comparing this to the Wii, it's a different market area. The 360 has much better graphics than the Wii does. That's on purpose - the Wii doesn't support high definition. The Wii's motion-sensing controllers are actually a *ton* of fun for sports and party games, so if you like to play a lot of golf or \"party fun\" types of things, you might swing towards the Wii. If you're more a hard core gamer and love games like FarCry or Prey, it's the 360 that you'll want. The harder comparison is between the XBox 360 and the PS3. Both support high definition graphics. Both have incredible RPGs on them (Fable, Final Fantasy). Both have incredible combat style games on them (Gears of War, Resistance). Both have hard drives for easy game saves, both have wireless controllers which I love. Both play previous-gen games. One way to look at this is that you should get the system that supports the franchises you love. If you are completely addicted to Final Fantasy, go with the PS3. That way you can play all the old FF games and enjoy the new ones. If you are a Halo Head, and play Halo 24 hours a day, then the XBox 360 is your sure bet. But what if you fall in the middle? I can tell you the 360 is really loud - but the PS3 gets really hot. Both seem prone to failure if poorly cared for - but both have worked perfectly fine for us so far. What else would swing your vote? With the huge head start XBox has on the Live feature, I would have to give a nod to the XBox if you are interested in online multiplay. Sure, both the 360 and the PS3 support it - but XBox has had it for years, and many people have built up quite a network. There are tons of people online at all hours of the day or night. It's been tried, tested, and is stable. On the other hand, if you're looking for an all-in-one media center, the PS3 with its 60 gig hard drive has the advantage. It makes it super easy for you to organize your photos, music, and much more right in the system. You don't have to siphon things from your PC or come up against quickly running out of space. I still question why the 360 only has 20 gigs of data - and they fill almost half of it up right away with system files. With Microsoft now offering to let you download high definition movies - at about 5 gig each - that's going to fill up your entire hard drive after only one or two movies. They really need to offer larger hard drives quickly. But until then, if you're an online player, a Halo fan, or just can't get your hands on a PS3 and are tired of playing low-def games, I highly recommend the XBox 360. There are a ton of games on this system that we love, and we actively use it. Even with the Wii and PS3 in the house, there are many games that are great on the XBox 360 and we choose to play them. Let me know if you have any specific questions on this system!</td><td>After a Year, Still a Great System</td><td>1166400000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>94253</td><td>3.0</td><td>58</td><td>false</td><td>12 18, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000JFJHQY</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Where Brain Boost Gamma Wave helps with memory, Brain Boost Beta Wave helps with your concentration. I think pretty much ANY video game should help with that! Every video game has you focussing on the task at hand, whether it's defeating the current boss or solving a puzzle. Still, I'm a sucker for brain boosting games. I play and enjoy Brain Age, Big Brain Academy, and several others. Studies have certainly shown that your brain is a \"use it or lose it\" part of your body. So just how does this game help with your concentration? First, the plot. It involves scientist, robots, and silliness. I really don't see why any brain game should have a plot. The other Brain Age style games don't bother. To have to page through screens here to get to the actual game is a bit silly. Hopefully their future releases will dispense with those meaningless screens you have to page past. So, the actual game itself. There are five minigames. These are: Find a Match - they show you a grid of images, and you click on the two that match. Shape Recognition - they show you a tetris-like image, and you have to choose which of the four images shown match it. Addition - they show you a bunch of numbers, and you have to sum them up. Remember Sequence - they show you a series of images, and then you have to click on which one was the \"3rd shown\" or \"5th shown\" or whatever they choose. Moving Dots - I actually like this one. They put a random number of dots on the screen, in motion. You have to count them up while they're moving and click on the total. I really have to question how some of these have anything to do with concentration. Adding up numbers isn't a matter of concentration. It's a matter of math skill. Finding a match would seem more like memory to me. I suppose since they titled the other brain game \"memory\" they had to name this *something* to convince you to buy both of them, but I'm just not seeing the concentration angle. Also, you have four levels for each of these mini-games, and then all you do is move on to the challenges. The challenges come in four levels and ... yes, it's the exact same 5 minigames. So you're playing the exact same games, it's just that they are now \"challenges\" instead of \"training\". There isn't any charting of your progress. You have no idea if you did better yesterday than you did today. In the training area, you just max each level out to 100% and then it's done. You're only doing 20 of each puzzle so it's not THAT hard. Maybe I'm spoiled by Brain Age and Big Brain Academy. Those games test your brain, but they are really *fun*, they track your progress, they make you want to come back and play again tomorrow. They show you how well you're doing. With this game, it feels like homework, and you don't even get a sense of accomplishment or progress.

Jak can now use both Light and Dark eco powers, too! Sure, there are a lot of comparisons between this game and the Ratchet & Clank series. And yes, both are similar in many ways. But I wouldn't say one is \"better\" than the other. Both have their unique traits that make them equally as fun. I definitely buy both and enjoy both greatly. With Jak 3, you get a massive 'wasteland' to explore and run missions in, in a variety of dune buggies. There is also a desert city (Fremen and Dune, anyone?) and of course your home city to explore. There are missions involving riding missiles, riding hoverboards, stomping around in four legged tanks, searching for eggs, zooming on races a la pod racer, and much more. The storyline is fun, but very linear. It's always quite clear what you need to do next to progress the game along. You earn weapons upgrades as you go, and earn secrets to alter gameplay in a variety of fun ways. The sound is reasonable, and the graphics are cartoony but well done, especially the animation in the cut scenes. The characters move very fluidly. I do have to say that gameplay balance is a bit uneven. Some missions you fly through with no problem at all, and wonder what the deal was. Other missions you replay 30 times in a row until you manage by chance to get through it OK. If you get a walkthrough guide and just zip from egg to egg, sure you can finish it very quickly. If you actually take the time to explore the areas, seek out items for yourself, and play with the various mini-games, you could enjoy the game for several weeks. I'm not sure that the game is a replayable-minded as Ratchet, though. With Ratchet, we gladly replayed it many times to get the upgrades and secrets only available on the multiple passes through the game. With Jak 3, we're just happy to be done with it.

The server holds the worlds that the players explore 24 hours a day - a world populated by computer-controlled people (NPCs, or non-player characters), by monsters, and by many, many other gamers. It is in many way a role-player's dream come true. Where Ultima Online uses a top-down, isometric view a la Baldur's Gate, EverQuest goes for the in-your-face style of Doom or Thief. You can rotate through to other views, but the character-point-of-view seems to work best, truly immersing yourself in your world. You begin by choosing a server to play on - each server hosts a set of characters, quests, and NPCs. A given CD can allow up to 8 characters on each server. If you don't like a character, you can immediately delete it and make a new one - a nice feature compared to some of the other gaming systems that make you wait a week or more. On the downside, your new character only starts with a weapon and some food. The other gaming systems start you with a good amount of cash, which is why they don't let you simply cycle through characters in an attempt to build up wealth. With the characters being polygon-based, they have done a nice job of allowing different facial features on the characters. You can choose from a wide variety of races. The traditional human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, etc. are here, but they throw in a lizard race, ogres, trolls, and intelligent black \"erudites\". On the downside, only the erudite is of color - everyone else is a \"tan\" with fixed hair and body. With Ultima Online, you can fully customize your hair color, length, and style, and skin color. Classes (or professions) are done in the D&D-2 style instead of the new edition. This means that choosing a certain race limits which classes are available to you. The typical classes of paladin, warrior, wizard, ranger, etc. are available. You can choose from being an axe-wielding dwarf, a elven bowman, a human wizard, or many other combinations. You then customize your various statistics - strenght, charisma, intelligence, etc. to finalize your character. There can only be one character of a given name in each world, which cuts down greatly on confusion between characters. Where some other gaming systems might have ten \"Bilbos\" running around, some good and some bad, in EverQuest you are the only character of your name in your server. You start out in a city that promotes your race and profession. You can talk to the guild leader there, get some initial training for free, and maybe hear about a quest or two. You can start talking to other characters that roam the city, finding where the best lairs of monsters are, or perhaps of other interesting goings-on. Once you practice moving about in the city, it's time to head out into the Real World. The world of EverQuest is *huge*, and as in most of these on line servers, it can literally take hours to walk across the continents. With the frontal view of EverQuest, you walk amongst the trees, past the shrubs, and see the monsters fly and wander right past you, scaled appropriately to size. The small snakes slither underfoot, while bats fly past your head and larger beasts tower over you. This is one area where EverQuest clearly shines - the immersive quality of exploration is fantastic. You have to learn 'sense heading' as you go. Each time you use any skill, be it swimming, fishing, clothes making, direction finding or fighting, you gain experience and knowledge in that skill. After killing a few of the vermin of the forest, you gain items and money, which you can trade in for better weapons, armors or spells, and on you go. The beauty of the system is that it is open-ended, and that there are always players to interact with, no matter what your schedule is. If you work third shift or are an early riser, there are players there. If you're a night owl or have a few hours free in the afternoon, there those players are. You can leave your character when you're done, and when you return, your character will be exactly as you left it. The world around you, however, will NOT be - it has been growing and changing in the hours you were away! It's an incredibly dynamic system, constantly changing, with real life people interacting with it. The ability to learn trade skills (like fishing, or cooking, or clothes making) greatly helps you become 'self supportive' and even create things for other characters. The inventory system has its good and bad points. The graphics are great, letting you see large, 3-dimensional images of the swords, backpacks, spell books, and other items. They are easy to keep track of and use, compared to other on line systems. On the downside, you can only carry 8 types of objects other than what you are wearing. If you get a backpack or sack you can increase this amount, but that is a bit limiting in the beginning. Highly recommended because of the large number of roleplayers that help populate this world, and because of the high quality first-person graphics. Downsides include the integrated player-vs-player combat, where other systems keep pvp in its own 'area' so those who do not wish to fight players do not have to. Another downside is lack of detailed customization of a character's appearance.</td><td>A role-player's dream come true</td><td>977097600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>17829</td><td>5.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>12 18, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00004UG9B</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The third in an increasing popular series of Bond video games, The World is Not Enough follows in the tradition of Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies. In TWiNE, you play Bond, James Bond, as he goes through the various stages of the movie. Each mission represents one section of the plot, starting from the banking building in Spain and moving onward. The missions tend to be longer and more drawn out then the movie showed, making the game last far longer than the movie did! The graphics are stellar on this version, a big enhancement from the last two games. Bond is very realistic looking, as are the various people he meets and talks to. You interact with people in a variety of ways, from watching civilians huddle in fear to exchanging witty comments with the bad guys. And, yes, there are times that you have to pull out your P2K and start plugging holes in those who will not listen to reason. While the game does have its shoot-it-out aspects, it is much more than a first-person shooter. It's much more like Thief, where you can find sneaky, non-violent ways around many situations. Want to get into a room? You can run in with guns blazing, taking out anyone who crosses your path. Favor a more thoughtful approach? Try running when the camera is pointing the other way, and ducking into nooks. The tools of the trade are wonderfully done and quite useful. A fingerprint scanner lets you steal fingerprints off a coffee thermos, getting you into restricted areas. Block the metal detector with a spinning gizmo straight out of a sci-fi movie. Don't the guards notice you walking around with this thing? Sometimes it's better not to ask questions. The cut scenes between missions are straight out of the movie, and hints help nudge you through the mission if you choose to use them. There are choices of difficulty, so you can play through on the easier level and then go back for a harder challenge. Playing well also unlocks cheats, so do your best! In all, a great game for any action fan, available on both Nintendo-64 and Playstation.</td><td>Great fun for any Bond fan</td><td>977097600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>15195</td><td>5.0</td><td>33</td><td>false</td><td>12 18, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00004SWLT</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I was a huge Banjo Kazooie fan - the dialogue was fun, the action was great, and the bizarre creatures you turned into and puzzles to solve were amazing.

It's not just a find-100-of-this game either - there are combinations of things to do, and puzzles to solve, creatures to rescue and mazes to explore The mini-games are amazingly fun by themselves. My boyfriend got hooked on the kickball game and kept going back for more! There are more egg varieties, more jinjos of various colors, more of everything. Each world is nicely put together with its own theme, with all sorts of really funny things going on in it.

More than a standard action puzzle game, Monkey Island glows with a keen sense of humor and a nefarious mind for tricky combinations. Your hero, Guybrush Threepwood, is back again - this time as a married pirate with a governer-wife. You roam around the islands, finding yourself a pirate crew, fighting duels and figuring out the various riddles that challenge you.  The dialogue is great. They throw in references to everything under the sun, from 'Zillionaire, Mansion and a Yacht' jokes about Bugs Bunny to sly comments about the OJ Simpson trial. There's something for every age group in here. I was very disappointed that they included a walkthrough *with* the software - I'm quite sure that many, many people will use the walkthrough without trying to figure out the puzzles on their own. Yes, they can be tricky sometimes, but the whole point of the game is to get that \"Aha!!\" moment when you get the right combination to work. Using the walkthrough skips tons of fun dialogue and results that only occur when you trial-and-error your way through. throughout. Other downsides include its tendency to crash (save OFTEN) and the confusing controls for movement. The graphics are great, though, and there is no way I could resist a game this witty.

As a whole, it has plenty of its own merits, but doesn't really live up to the legacy of either series. Killzone 2 depicts a war between the \"good guy\" ISA and the \"bad guy\" Helghast. The former are conventional-looking space marines, while the latter are clad in gas masks and bulky gear. Really, though, the storyline acknowledges that there aren't many differences between the two sides morally; both sides are guilty of various war crimes, and so on. Otherwise, the story is completely standard for a space-based game. In single player, you play as an ISA special forces soldier fighting through waves of enemies to try to capture the Helghast leader. In multiplayer, you take on the role of a soldier on either side of the conflict. The game's FPS system is nothing particularly special. Killzone 1 made an effort to show the player's body, for example when climbing ladders. This was meant to be different than older games that treated the player like a box with a gun strapped to it. In Killzone 2, that spirit is alive, but it's no longer \"unique\", so it just feels like a standard FPS. The weapons handle somewhat poorly, but not in a badly-designed way; rather, it feels like the game is trying to emulate the difficulty of actually handling weapons. The player moves and turns slower than many other First Person Shooter characters. Additionally, for whatever reason peripheral vision is poorly represented in the game; playing online, I was often ambushed - and was able to easily ambush others - from their side, and generally nobody attacked from the side noticed they were being shot at until they had already died. There is also a cover system available in single player mode, where the player takes cover and ducks out to shoot; oddly, this system is not usable in multiplayer, and players must make do with ducking behind cars or walls. The game has a fairly standard complement of weapons, with a few more unique guns in the single-player mode. Both the ISA and Helghast have a standard assault rifle (though the ISA's rifle has a better sight than the Helghast one), and there's the usual assortment of shotguns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers. In the campaign, more exotic guns are featured; flamethrowers, bolt-guns that staple enemies to the wall, and lightning guns. All of these guns have fairly detailed reactions from their victims, which is at least more interesting than the standard \"shoot them and they die\". Finally, there are two types of grenades: frag grenades, which can be \"cooked off\" to detonate on impact, and lightning grenades, which shoot out tendrils of lightning instead of exploding. Neither is thrown particularly well, and they usually seem to fall short of where they ought to go. Multiplayer is one of the main attractions of the game; its primary feature is how it handles game modes. When you go into a game, each map is divided into multiple rounds. Each round is a random game type (depending on the server), so you can have a regular Team Deathmatch followed by a Capture The Flag round followed by a Bomb-Planting mode. This makes for a more fun and dynamic mix than most games, where you end up playing the same game mode all the time. The game modes also do a good job of staying reasonably in-character, rather than being outlandish or ridiculous; the \"capture the flag\" mode is actually grabbing a single propaganda speaker and putting it in a safe location, rather than stealing an enemy's flag from their base. Multiplayer also contains a class system, similar to Battlefield or Team Fortress. At the start, the player can only use the Soldier class armed with a default assault rifle. As they play the game, they gain points that grant them levels. Leveling up grants new weapons for the soldier class and entirely new classes. The soldier class is the most widely armed class, as it can be equipped with an assault rifle, a shotgun, a submachine gun, a light machine gun, or a rocket launcher. The medic class can only be armed with an assault rifle, but is capable of reviving near-dead allied units. The engineer class has a shotgun and can build sentry turrets and ammo boxes. The tactician class can set new spawn points for allied units and call in air strikes. The assault class runs faster and has more health than a normal soldier, but can only be armed with explosive weapons (not good for close-combat situations). Saboteurs can disguise themselves as members of the enemy team and throw C4. Finally, scouts are the only class capable of wielding sniper rifles; they also have the ability to cloak themselves and mark enemy units with data that's transmitted to allied units (so that everyone can see where an enemy is). In addition to direct leveling-up, there are certain actions that give permanent rewards. For example, having ten games where you score more than ten kills grants you an extra frag grenade on every spawn, while having ten games where you score 20 points and don't kill yourself or any allies grants you more ammo. These kinds of bonuses are primarily useful for longevity; that is, they don't affect actual combat, but just allow you to get more done without having to go back to an ammo resupply (which is useful in and of itself). The multiplayer maps are probably the game's best point. Ranging from urban environments to military bases to remote wasteland villages, the maps are huge without being overwhelming. They add to a feeling of having an entire battlefield, and combat will generally move around to different points of the map based on objectives. Therefore, it avoids what a lot of games have where combat always ends up being in the same spot. It's also a lot less linear than a lot of FPS maps, allowing keen players to sneak around the enemy lines and take them from behind. As a whole, Killzone 2 is a solid game. There's nothing new or unique about it, but it works and it's fun. Currently, it doesn't have a lot of competition on the PS3 (whereas with an Xbox release it would have most likely been overshadowed by Halo 3), so PS3 owners owe it to themselves to buy this. However, by itself, it's not worth buying a PS3 for. We purchased Killzone with our own personal funds.

Known either as Albatross 18 or Pangya in its online world, the Super Swing Golf version for the Wii is strictly off-line. In this Wii variation, there is a little bit of plot, but it really doesn't matter. You're on the fictional island of Pangya and there are evil forces at work. Really, this game is just about choosing a character, choosing a caddy,and playing golf. There are a variety of courses to play on - you start with a few options, and more become available as you go. There are cool variations - snowy courses with icy lakes, desert courses where you hit through pyramid areas, rainy courses, cloudy courses, fairy tale courses. You can play tournament style and match play. There is a training mode to help you get started. As you play well, you earn Pangya Points, which you then spend in the store. You can buy yourself new outfits, clubs, items and more. Each gives you some sort of benefit - more strength, higher accuracy, and so on. Some are special one-time-use items that let you calm down the wind, see visually how your putt will work, and other neat features. The graphics are reasonably nice - it's obviously cartooney, but you see what you need to in order to play. The greens are shown with a grid full of dots, with the dots representing the slope of each specific grid. It works, although it's not as helpful as other golf games in determining slope. The camera views - showing overhead and target views of your shots - are OK, but again, other games provide much more complete fly-overs and detailed layouts of the hole you're playing. From a golf point of view, the game isn't very accurate, either. When you swing, you literally bring your Wii remote up and then stop, waiting until you get to the right spot on the swing-o-meter. You press the button and then swing down through to hit the shot. It's very unnatural. The swing should be all one fluid motion and the game should know when you reach the top of your swing by itself. Also, the pars set for some of the courses are nonsensical. A par should always assume you need two putts to sink the ball into the hole. The game doesn't do that - some pars seem almost randomly assigned. Still, this game really isn't aimed at real golfers who want to practice their skills. It's aimed at casual players who aren't worried about accuracy - but who want fun watching their balls send out fireworks as they fly. While I don't see why a game can't be fun *and* accurate, I accept that game developers make odd decisions sometimes when making their games. For example, why do they have numerous \"concept art\" unlockables of barely teen girls in bikinis? How does this relate to golf? The mind boggles. Fun enough to play with up to four players in your home, or single player, but do remember that this doesn't go online - and that it's not going to be as good as other golf games if you're looking for a realistic golfing experience. Well recommended for casual fun sports play.</td><td>Fun Casual Golfing - Missing a Few Real Golf Features</td><td>1166313600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>89110</td><td>4.0</td><td>107</td><td>false</td><td>12 17, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000GHLBUA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The problem with games like Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz is that you have rabid fans of the series - some who love them no matter what, and others who hate any slight change, no matter how small. That means that no matter how well or poorly the Wii version was, those who loved the game on previous platforms will either hate it for changing - or love it because it has the same theme. Let me first say that I love the Super Monkey Ball series in general. I grew up playing the actual marble game - Labyrinth - that this is based on. In the Monkey Ball games, there is a marble (holding a monkey) that rolls around on a surface. You tilt that surface via the controls, to move the marble. Your aim is to gather up bananas, avoid obstacles, stay on course and reach the goal. There are both the main game path, which involves trickier and trickier courses to navigate, as well as mini-games. With the Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz version for the Wii, you get an entirely new level of interactivity. In essence it's becoming more \"real\". In previous versions you pressed buttons to tilt the board - but now you are actually *tilting* the controller. You're in essence playing with a real board, with a real marble. You tilt your controller forward, the marble rolls forward. It is incredibly intuitive. For some people, like me, this is great. It's no longer a button press \"translating\" into motion. Your hand is causing the motion. I can hand the controller to anybody that comes into my house, show them the game, and they get it immediately. It's physics, it's beautiful. While this is great, it also means that it gets challenging for really little kids. They don't have great hand-eye coordination yet. While they might be OK with button pressing, they aren't wonderful at holding a controller steady to guide a marble along a path. They probably aren't playing professional soccer either. I'm not saying this is \"bad\" - but I'm saying it's something you have to accept. The challenge level of this game is fine for kids in the intro levels, but the later levels are meant to challenge talented gamers. Little kids might feel stumped here. They can always replay those earlier levels to try to get all the points there, and practice their skills until their bodies catch up. In addition to the main gameplay path, there are 50 mini-games. This is of course a huge number, but as with any new release, some are upset that their previous favorites are altered. That's going to be true with any new game. I have to agree that some mini-games here aren't my favorites. I specifically don't like the games like the \"harpoon\" games that make me \"thrust\" my spear into fish. I don't find that thrusting motion with the Wii to be very accurate. On the other hand, I love some of the other games. That's why they give you 50 of them - you'll like some, dislike others. I'm sure other people love the fish game and hate some of my favorites. If you're fond of some of the previous GameCube mini-games, heck, stick the GameCube game into the Wii to play them. The Wii takes the older discs, after all. In general the graphics are quite nice, bright and colorful. The music also strikes the right note of fun and casual gameplay. The real beauty of this series - and the Wii controllers - is that you can get anybody to walk into your house and within minutes they grasp what is going on and play along. You can't say that for most XBox 360 or PS3 titles, or even for several other of the Wii games we own. I really do give Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz great kudos for what they have here. If I had any complaint, it's that they might have wanted to add a \"super easy\" mode so that little kids could play through the entire game even if they lacked coordination. This is one of those super-kid-friendly games and while it could allow adults to cheat, I think the benefit to little tykes to \"get through the game\" and be happy would be worth it.</td><td>Great Fun but a Mite Tricky for Tykes</td><td>1166313600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>61225</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>12 17, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00064MUIA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The sequel for the GameBoy Advance, the Nintendo DS features two screens of gameplay, and a folding clamshell design to protect those screens from harm. The top screen is a traditional, classic screen. The bottom screen is a PDA-style touch screen that works with a stylus (plastic pen). The D-pad is on the left of the lower screen, the directionals on the right. You get stereo sound, a microphone, and best of all, built in wireless connections! That means that you can play games with up to 15 other people in your area without any cables at all. Everyone on your bus could chat or challenge each other. Study hall and waiting in line becomes an adventure. There's a built in clock and calendar, and you can even choose your name and favorite color. The game selection is, admittedly, pretty pitiful to start with. The few games that are out are really not that great. However, the DS lets you play not only the new games (on a very thin card like the Nokia) but also the old style cartridges as well. So you can bring your entire game library from your previous systems over to this new game! That gives you easily hundreds of games, many being sold at bargain-basement prices, to play on your new system - with the nice new controls and back-lit screens. The wireless built in PictoChat is SUPER fun. We have two DSs in our household and every time people come over, we get them playing with PictoChat. You immediately launch into games of pictionary, guess-the-shape, silly notes, and much more. You practically don't need a game, if you have someone fun to talk to! My only concern is with the durability of the touch screen. They do sell plastic protectors for the screens which I *highly* recommend. If you wear out that touch screen with all the games, you'll be pretty upset as it stops responding quickly in games. The one game we've found so far that is truly fun is the new Mario game, which lets you do mapping and selection choices on the bottom screen while you have the main view on the top. With the stereo sound and incredible graphics, it's really like playing a GameCube game on a system you can carry in your pocket. The other games that are out are OK, but not stellar. Still, even playing \"normal\" GBA and GB games on this system, the backlit screen is just as nice as with the GBA, and the clamshell design keeps the screens safe from damage. I highly, highly recommend getting your hands on this system - you can play all your existing games and picto-chat for hours while you watch for new games to be written for its super-cool dual interface!</td><td>Great  chat now - great games to come</td><td>1103241600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>61783</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>12 17, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0006B0O9U</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The first great game for the Nintendo DS system is Super Mario 64 DS.

It's been many years since then, but the Super Mario 64 DS version brings that same level of graphics and fun gameplay to the portable DS system. The dual screen really shines here - you can easily keep track of your map and objective on the lower screen while running around on the top screen. The graphics and sounds are classic, being just as fresh and fun now as they were during the initial release. Even better, the game has built in VS mode which you can play with other DS owners who don't even own the game! They download a quick applet, and instantly can run around various boards with you, seeking stars and tracking down specials. There are additional levels and minigames in this version of Super Mario 64 which are just as much fun as the main game.

Either you're the fellowship, struggling to destroy the ring, or you are working for the lands of Mordor, hoping to conquer all. The game is very much like its Command & Conquer and Warcraft predecessors. You get to choose a side, and then use strategy and warfare to reach your goals. You harvest food, build barracks and stables, and track your progress. As your troops move across the land, you uncover more terrain. The graphics are relatively well done, with rolling hills, trees, flying birds, and appropriate buildings based on the locations. You end up in the Mines of Moria, Lothlorien, and other well known locations. You often include key members of the story in your parties, from Aragorn to Legolas to Eomer and more. There is an overview mode where you can choose which territory to work on next, and as you progress through the game you build up your units and your skills. In addition to the main objectives, there are often bonus objectives to give you extra tasks to aim for. Because of this combination of overall scope and individual battle, the game is much more epic feeling compared to other games out there. The game isn't \"realistic\" in its graphics but they do draw you into the game. Of course having the game set in Middle Earth is a huge advantage for us fans of the Lord of the Rings story! It is great fun to play a strategy game and see Rohan cavalry thunder across the screen :) When you work on setting up a strategic situation, and then watch as hundreds of your troops take on hundreds of the enemy, in a true middle earth setting, it really is a thing of beauty. Perhaps the only downside is that occasionally you end up with a storyline different than the books - but isn't that the point of the game? If you knew what was going to happen, there'd be no point in playing ...

It shines in just about every aspect - graphics, replayability, enjoyability, intelligence of your in-game friends and enemies, even plot! You're working with the humans against the Covenant, on a ringworld much like many other ringworlds in Sci-fi. You often work with a team of marines against the enemies, and the marines actually work like a unit! They'll run down halls with you, laying covering fire. If the group is up against nasty odds, some marines will start worrying. If you're doing well and you snipe someone a marine was aiming at, they'll complain! There are lots of different weapons, each with its own fun attributes. When you're holding a weapon in your hand, you can see by its counter or the needles sticking out of it how much ammo is left in it. There are jeeps and other vehicles you can drive, and if you get near a marine, they'll jump in to help you out! Jeeps climb over terrain quite realistically, and if you flip one, you can even try to flip it back over. The graphics are just amazing. From the way the different missile types fly over the terrain, to the terrain itself, to night vision and zoom-in-sniper-rifles to the details on the enemies, it's truly like watching an animated feature come alive. The water ripples. The drop ships fly overhead - complete with shadow rippling over the landscape - and when they set down, you can watch as they open and the aliens inside come out. And start shooting you immediatley :) The whole interplay of plot and characters is great. One alien type is a little creature that runs around laughing, unless it feels threatened, in which case it waves its arms over its head and runs away yelling \"help! help!\". When a marine shoots one, sometimes he'll call out \"Who's laughing now?\" or other such jibes. Very little is \"contrived\" in this game. You really get a sense that you're moving forward with a purpose, and that your team is THERE with you. And, even better, you can multiplay in a way which is REALLY fun! With two players you still get a lot of screen space, and you can easily work as a team - flanking an enemy, coordinating attacks. Your marines will see this and help out. If one person jumps into the driver seat of a vehicle, the other can hop in back and man the machine gun. There is a rainbow of colors for your suit, too.

I watched as the graphics moved from blocky pixels to slightly less blocky shapes, to ships that you could actually see emblems on. This latest Star Wars space combat is the best I've seen yet! This Special Edition starts with the regular Starfighter title (available on other platforms) and adds in extra levels and tons of multiplayer features! To start with, there are three different characters you play, each in his or her own style of ship. Rhys is a Nabooian cadet with a little quick fighter, with limited torpedoes. Vana is a mercenary - her ship can tag enemies and then blast them. Nym is the alien, and he's got bombs on his, great for blasting capital ships. You take these three different ships on a series of missions, both on planet and in space. You dodge through asteroid belts, zip along narrow canyons, defend bases and blow apart the bases of your enemies. There's tons of fun dogfighting, trying to blow up ships both large and small. The missions make sense, and your wingmen obey commands with reasonable AI. The graphics are beautiful! There are rivers snaking through green valleys. Desolate planets with mining operations. Giant asteroid fields that you have to dodge through. The ships each look and act differently, but are generally similar enough that it's not a huge chore to switch amongst them as you go through missions.

Tekken, on the Playstation 2, is one of my favorites, with its shimmering waters and floating leaves. It's pretty amazing that barely a year later, it's been blown out of the water! First, I have to admit that the 'story mode' is very cheezy. Well, that's the same for any fighting game. You choose one of the many characters, choose an outfit, and jump into battles. Your person says a few words, the enemy says a few words, and they fight. With some good button-mashing, you can zip through any story in no time at all. That's not what these games are built for, though. They're best when played multiplayer against a real human opponent! The story mode and other training modes are just to get you to learn the moves. And this is where it truly begins to shine! There are a variety of fighting styles represented in the game, and each one has a wide number of moves. They're truly amazing once you get them down, and the graphics are incredible. Their movements are smooth and fluid, from the slice of the hand to the bouncing of the pom-poms. The backgrounds are true eye candy. There's a level where you're playing surrounded by aquariums, and even the floor you're on is the glass top of a fish tank! Another level has you fighting in the snow - and your feet mess up the snowdrifts! You can fight in a candle-surrounded room, with beautiful flickering fire, and knock them over with your opponent. Smash through a wall, and you're out on the roof! Roll off the roof, and you're down in the courtyard! It's truly like watching a fighting animation on tv, but you can control the action. Half the fun is figuring out the secrets of each level. Can you smash through the trees? Can you throw your enemy through that plate glass window? The water splashes with each step you take, the electric fence zaps your enemy, the neon sign flickers as you fall against it. This game definitely shows off the incredible capability of the X-Box, and is a must-have for anyone who loves fighting games. Even if you don't currently, this game might convince you why they're so much fun!</td><td>Amazing graphics and fighting styles</td><td>1008547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>169097</td><td>4.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>12 16, 2009</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B001BBOZYY</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The 6th Settlers game is a city-building sim similar to \"Dawn of Discovery\" or any of the Anno games. Its cutesy style, along with a fairly simple layout, makes it probably the most user-friendly game in the Settlers series, something that may not appeal to long-term fans. The Settlers VI operates on simple principles. There are two types of buildings: gatherers and producers. Gatherers are placed near resources like wood, stone, or wild animals, and gather those resources. Producers are \"city buildings\" and turn raw materials into usable product. There are only a few categories of product compared to earlier Settlers games. There's food (meat, bread, cheese, or fish), clothes (made from leather or wool), cleaning supplies (soap from animals or brooms from wood), and entertainment (mead, baths, or decorations). In each category, you only need one particular type of thing - compare this to Dawn of Discovery, where your citizens had very diverse tastes and needed all of them to be fulfilled equally. Not all the things you will need will be in your starting area, though. The game divides maps into different provinces; by making outposts in other provinces, you can secure their resources for your city. Choosing which provinces to expand into is a vital part of the game, especially in multiplayer when they are contested by several players. A new element in VI is the presence of Knights. Knights serve as avatars for the player, providing bonuses depending on which one is picked. The military knight, for example, produces soldiers more cheaply and can refill their supplies. The holy knight can heal sick settlers, the trade knight gets better deals off of trading with villages or other players, and so on. The knight you pick also serves as the voice of your advisor, notifying you of events around your city. Fulfilling short-term objectives, like giving your citizens clothes or cleaning supplies, allows your knight to be promoted in rank and unlock the next tier of buildings. As your knight gets promoted, the demands of your city grow, but so does your power as a ruler. Besides making sure everything is running smoothly, there are a few other things you can do with your citizens. You can call a sermon at your local cathedral; attendees will be happier, and will donate some money after it is over. You can declare a festival at your marketplace, which results in people getting married; housewives (or in one case, house-husbands) will take care of chores like retrieving food and clothes, leaving the actual business to their spouse. Finally, you can adjust taxes once you're high enough rank, meaning that if you're doing well with money you can drop off your taxes to make your citizens much happier (or raise taxes if you need cash quickly). There is also a military system present in the game. There are two types of soldiers: swordsmen and archers. The former are a melee class; the latter are a ranged class. Both sides use torches to attack structures, and they possess them in limited amounts (though they can refill them for free at military structures or outposts). There are also siege engines, used to attack stone walls (which don't burn). The combat in the game is very simple, and hinges primarily on numbers. However, the prosperity and happiness of your city also influences the quality of your soldiers, so keeping your people happy is a good way to ensure a strong military. In addition to the fairly enjoyable campaign mode, there are also some side scenarios and multiplayer options. The side scenarios aren't that great, and there are disappointingly few multiplayer maps. The presence of random maps would have done a lot to add replay value to the game outside of the campaign. There are four distinct climates in the game - mild (standard European), cold (Viking), warm (Spanish), and hot (Arabic). However, the climates only affect crops (the availability of crops at certain times of year and the presence of fertile ground) and the appearance of your castle. Villages on these maps will have unique climate-specific buildings, but your own city always has the same building styles. This is unfortunate, but understandable. Most of the buildings are nice to look at as it is, with a wide variety of roof-tile colors so you're not just looking at the same building repeated 20 times. In fact, making a satisfying city is one of the best parts of the game, further reinforced by the fact that your settlers and their spouses are all visible somewhere in the city going about their tasks (or loitering and chatting, if they've got nothing to do). The graphics are nice; the cartoonish look means that their ostensibly low quality goes unnoticed in favor of a more stylized approach. As mentioned, making beautiful cities is the high point of the game. Voice acting is somewhat laughable, but not actively terrible. The music is a little bit annoying, but not offensively so. Some sources complained of technical difficulties and crashes, but playing the game through the Gold Edition (purchased with the Steam online service), I had no problems of that nature. On the whole, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire is a good game, but better for more casual city-builders instead of hardcore settlers fans. The lack of free-play and city diversity is annoying, but not unmanageable.

In it, Big Boss must lead a unit of comrades against his former unit, the now-rogue FOX Unit. Most of the gameplay is similar to Metal Gear Solid 3 and its stealth-based gameplay, with a few new weapons added. Some things are limited by the PSP's buttons and systems, but for the most part it plays and looks like Metal Gear Solid 3. The camera is taken from Metal Gear Online, included with MGS3: Subsistence, and can be alternately helpful and annoying. A new sonar has been added, which shows the sound that both you and those near you are making, and gives a rough estimate of their position. The camouflage system is gone, now replaced with the \"blending system\". The main concept of the title is the \"Comrade system\", where you can acquire new allies to use in your fight against FOX. In early trailers, it seemed like Snake would be leading a squad (and thus multiple people would be active at once), but in truth, it is closer to other games of the series. Only one soldier can be active at a time (and thus player-controlled); the others wait in cardboard boxes hidden around the level. These soldiers can be switched to for the use of specific items (as each soldier has only four slots for weapons and items) or if the current soldier is hurt. Soldiers also have different \"sense\" levels, which is represented by a blue circle around their location. If an enemy moves into that circle the soldier will detect them and they will be marked on the map. Thus, scattering your soldiers around a level can create a sort of \"net\".However, the emphasis is still on single infiltration, and is supplemented by a new form of sneaking: soldiers can \"blend in\" with other soldiers in similar costume. For example, a standard orange-suited guard could blend in amongst similarly suited guards. This does not work when approaching an enemy of a different class; the same guard would not be able to get past an officer or even a scientist. Suspicious activities (like crawling, sneaking, or pointing a gun) will also cancel blending. A new map interface is used; different areas are marked on the map similar to Metal Gear Acid. Going to a level takes one half-day, and it switches between day and night. The game starts in November of 1970, and as far as is known there is no \"time limit\" for missions. A large part of the system is acquiring and using your comrades. Snake begins alone, but can subdue and drag enemy soldiers back to his HQ (a truck, which his support on this mission drives). Between missions, Snake can manage his comrades, assigning them to different units. The Sneaking Unit accompanies Snake on his mission (or in some cases goes on the mission by themselves) and consists of four four-man teams. One team can be deployed in an area at a time. Spy Units report on events in different areas and will inform Snake of weapons and comrades that can be picked up in areas. Sometimes the spies will bring storyline-important data (the location of a hidden base or the location of a certain individual). Certain spies can also help map out an area and locate items, or reduce the health of enemies in that area. The tech unit researches new gadgets for Snake and his team, much like \"Q\" from James Bond. Scientists and mechanics are best for this role. The medical unit not only provides medicine, but they also heal units who are recovering from missions (IE at the base when another team goes on a mission). There are many different types of soldier to recruit in this game. Standard grunts, officers, female soldiers, and elite FOX Unit members. There is even a way to recruit some bosses by using a tranquilizer gun. This contrasts with other Metal Gear Solid games, where tranquilizing a boss would still end up with them dying and the story remaining the same. Soldiers also improve their maximum HP and Stamina levels as they go on missions. There are different levels of proficiency with different weapons (C, B, A, and S, from worst to best) that are ingrained with soldiers (so having a person who is bad at shotguns use a shotgun a lot will not help). A large concern is that if a character dies, they are dead forever (unless you restart a level) so taking care of your soldiers is important. The storyline has many twists and turns, some of which are important and some of which seem like they fall under George Lucas' Episode II problems (fitting in characters from other parts of the series in a place where they don't really fit).There are references to other games even in the clothes the people wear; the FOX Unit soldiers wear the uniform Snake wore in Metal Gear Solid 3 (with Tiger Stripe camo) and the FOX Unit's leader wears the same trenchcoat that Big Boss and the rebellious members of FOXHOUND wear in MGS1. There is a great deal of online connectivity in this game. The first kind, for the more casual player, is using Wireless Connections to gain new characters. The network doesn't even need to be connected; the PSP just needs to see that there is a wireless connection there. Some characters are accessible from this process that can't be gained through the normal game, such as members of the Ocelot Unit or KGB. If these characters die, they're gone, and a wireless connection can't be used twice. There are also ways to get soldiers through a GPS Scan (which requires a not-yet-released peripheral) and Passwords (which will be released through \"media outlets\"). There are online and local death-match modes. A team is taken from the player's single-player game and put online to fight enemies with their equipped items. Some games can result in the loss of a character to an opponent or the gain of a character if you win, while others are just friendly games with no stakes. There is also a \"Cyber-Survival\" mode in which a squad is sent off onto the Internet and fights other squads automatically. This only requires connection twice: the first time to drop off the squad, and later to pick them up. Once they are input the squad is automatically in the system. Through this, as with the death-match modes, squad members can be won and lost. There is some strategy, essentially focusing on which characters are where and who has what. The graphics are based on MGS3's graphics, with some minor reductions (no bullet casings, no blood, some less-detailed textures). The cutscenes are done in a stylized comic book manner, similar to the Metal Gear Solid Digital Graphic Novel, and it switches between looking amazing and being annoying. Overall, this is a fun game to pick up for the PSP. The multitude of characters is a plus, but the squad-based gameplay seems wasted. Early videos showed a team supporting each other directly, with Snake giving commands to his two allies. In contrast, the \"one person sneaking and three people hiding\" mode doesn't seem as exciting. The storyline was also disappointing in several areas. However, if you are looking for a fun extension of Metal Gear Solid 3 and its online mode, this is a great game.</td><td>Canon Content with Nice Graphics</td><td>1166227200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>94960</td><td>5.0</td><td>105</td><td>false</td><td>12 16, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000JV78XC</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Elebits is a \"collecting\" game where your aim is to gather up little electrical life forms while completely demolishing the room you're in. It is quite satisfying, and fun for all ages! It's sort of hard to describe the appeal of this game. In some ways it's like describing the appeal of the Sims series. What's so fun about walking around a virtual home, interacting with it? For some reason, we humans just like to do that. In elebits, you walk into a \"bedroom\" for example. It's got all the normal items a bedroom has - shelves, books on the shelves, lamps, electronic items, etc. Every single distinct item in the room can be interacted with. You can take individual books off the shelves, move the shelf, move the bed, turn on items, and much more. But you're not just walking around picking up books and examining them. Instead, you have a raygun that lets you whirl these items around in your frenzied search for Elebits. It's really best if you ignore the plot here, but this is the gist of it. You're a spoiled little girl who has two scientist parents. You are insanely jealous of the object of your parents' research - electrically charged elebits. However, when the power goes out in your town and your parents leave you behind to go look into the problem, you promptly pick up your dad's \"ray gun\" to start zapping Elebits on your own. The more you gather up, the more of your electronic devices and lights that begin working again. So the game is non-violent, but wildly \"fun destructive\". You go around zapping at the little Elebits creatures to gather them up. You have a time deadline, so you're wildly flinging things in the room around - vacuum cleaners, computers, books, lamps - to find where they're hiding. The more Elebits you gather up, the more power you have to lift heavier items. When you charge up enough power, you can start turning on TVs and other devices - which then releases more Elebits. It gives the game a bit of strategy, knowing that you have to track down enough elebits to get through Door 1, to then turn on Item 2, and so on. The controls are pretty straightforward - you point at an elebit, and push the button to suck it up. Sometimes it's challenging to figure out WHERE on an item to \"push the switch\" to turn it on. For example you might know that the lamp can be activated, but you have to spin around it to figure out exactly where that darn ON switch is. Even if you think the story mode is completely silly, wait until you get your hands on the level editor. You can then create your own levels, with your own rules, or even create complex Domino-chain styles of situations using all of the in game objects. Then you can load your level online for others to see and enjoy! This could easily keep you occupied for weeks. Well recommended, if you're into this style of non-violent but wackily destructive fun!</td><td>Great for Kids, Fun Level Editor, All Around Fun</td><td>1166227200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>61119</td><td>5.0</td><td>16</td><td>false</td><td>12 16, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00064MUIA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>We have owned our Nintendo DS for two years - we bought it right when it released in December 2004. Here are our feelings after two years of playing this unit pretty much daily. The sequel for the GameBoy Advance, the Nintendo DS features two screens of gameplay, and a folding clamshell design to protect those screens from harm. The top screen is a traditional, classic screen. The bottom screen is a PDA-style touch screen that works with a stylus (plastic pen). The D-pad is on the left of the lower screen, the directionals on the right. You get stereo sound, a microphone, and best of all, built in wireless connections! That means that you can play games with up to 15 other people in your area without any cables at all. Everyone on your bus could chat or challenge each other. Study hall and waiting in line becomes an adventure. There's a built in clock and calendar, and you can even choose your name and favorite color. There are now an amazing collection of games available for the DS. I love the Brain Age type games, where you can improve your memory and alertness with fun daily practice games. I also like the Animal Crossing and Zoo Tycoon style games where you care for animals and build up worlds. There are even great RPGs like Trace Memory that let you get involved in long term gameplay. The DS lets you play not only the new games (on a very thin card which you want to take some care in handling) but also the old style cartridges as well. So you can bring your entire game library from your previous systems over to this new game! That gives you easily hundreds of games, many being sold at bargain-basement prices, to play on your new system - with the nice new controls and back-lit screens. The wireless built in PictoChat is SUPER fun. We have two DSs in our household and every time people come over, we get them playing with PictoChat. You immediately launch into games of pictionary, guess-the-shape, silly notes, and much more. You practically don't need a game, if you have someone fun to talk to! We were initially concerned with the durability of the touch screen. They do sell plastic protectors for the screens which I *highly* recommend. If you wear out that touch screen with all the games, you'll be pretty upset as it stops responding quickly in games. With those screens in place, we haven't had any issues at all. We don't hammer the touch screens, but we aren't super gentle with them either. After two years, they still respond as quickly as when we first got them. We do own two PSPs as well. Yes, the graphics on the PSP are MUCH better.  I'm not saying this is bad, it's just something to recognize as a fact of life. It's *meant* to be a simpler game system. It's like comparing the Wii against the PlayStation 3. But just like with the Wii and PSP, it's an entirely different situation. Sure, the PSP gives movies and high quality graphics. However, the DS touch screen and microphone provide really fun gameplay even if the graphics are sometimes pixelly. Does Mario really need pores in his face to be fun? I think not!

I was a beta-tester for Earth & Beyond, which came out just when other 'first round' on line role playing games were getting revamped. Even with the other games trying to spiff up their graphics, Earth & Beyond was just amazing with the environments you explored. Think of this as Wing Commander on line. You get to choose one of six different kinds of characters - from explorers to warriors to tradesmen and more. The amount of character customization is simply PHENOMONAL. You get to customize hair color, style, eye color, facial features, you name it. Then your ship gets customized too! You can change the colors of the various parts of it and even add a name and decal to it. The game is very vocally based, so make sure your sound card is working properly. You get a very nicely done tutorial to help you through learning how to pilot and fight with your ship. Then you are set loose to explore your new world. You can team up with other on line players or just roam around on your own. There are missions to take on, and rewards if you do. If you don't want to, you can just explore and have fun. You spend most of your time in your ship, but you can also dock at bases or on planets and walk around in character. You can buy new items, customize your ship, take on missions, chat with fellow players. Each type of character gets bonusses for various types of activities. So for explorers, flying around to far-off areas and learing about them gets you your bonusses. Did I mention the gorgeous graphics? Your character and ship are greatly detailed, from the shadows on the ship to the trails from its engines as it spins through space, to the planets and space docks and everything else. If you don't have a GEforce 3 or 4, grab one! It's simply amazing how good the graphics look on a game that active has thousands of people playing in the world at once. Highly recommended for any space flight fan. Those who are looking for wizards and dwarves delving in caves might be better off with one of the other more traditional MMORPGs.</td><td>Amazing graphics and great fun for space fans</td><td>1039996800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>452029</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>12 16, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000053UJ2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Anarchy Online came out after the trilogy of Ultima Online / EverQuest / Asheron's Call. It learned from many of their mistakes and right out of the gate presented a fun, immersive world. There is more 'context' to this game than to most of the other MMORPGs out there. You are on a mining planet which a corporation is trying to get rich from. You can join the side of that corporation, the side of the rebels fighting against them, or be neutral in the middle. Other MMORPGs featured varying levels of customization - maybe the skin, maybe a hairstyle. Anarchy Online went full tilt into this fun and let you customize just about ANYTHING. Choose which race you want to be. Choose from a wide range of classes, each with its own skills. Choose skin color, facial details, and much more. As this is a future world, there is \"nano-technology\". This means you can enhance your abilities both by using the skills you want to do better in, or enhancing yourself the scientific way. The training missions are good and get you involved in your world. There's no \"hunting for friends\" - you are already starting as part of a big team that has a clear agenda. You can then choose to work on missions to help your team out, or just wander around and do what you want. You can form groups within your team to take on special challenges, or you can go it alone. The graphics are great, from the wildernesses to the big cities to the swamps and marshes. There's both the high-tech of a future world and the low-tech of the planet you're on. The monsters are really great, and in the training area you run into \"L33Ts\" who spout off hilarious L33T-Speak!! While other MMORPGs tend to have lots of people who are in it for \"gaining lots of points\" and don't care much about actual roleplay, Anarchy Online is great for its level of roleplay. People really do get into their characters, and talk about the aims of the group and the missions involved instead of going on \"experience point quests\" to \"get my character to the next level.\" We've played every MMORPG that has come out to test it and get screenshots. Anarchy Online is one of the few that we actually kept an account for and continued to play. We still find it great fun, and the constant improvements make the world even better as it matures.</td><td>Great graphics, great RP and great design</td><td>1039996800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>88880</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>12 15, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000GEDN5E</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Rayman Raving Rabbids is in essence a collection of fun mini-games which involve both the Wii controller and nunchuck. Make sure you've got a lot of energy for this one! Ignore the plot, it really doesn't matter. The key is that you have to win 3 out of 4 mini-games, go through a boss level, then do another 3 out of 4 mini-games to progress, and so on. Each of the mini-games is different, and many are quite inventive. There are the classic \"marble in maze\" games where you tilt the controller to guide the marble. There are drawing puzzles where you have to trace, with the controller, lines on the screen. There are shooting games where you're \"run along a rail\" and all you do is point and shoot. You're shooting plungers, so this is very kid-friendly. There are numerous in-jokes in this game. For example, on one of the shooting levels, some of the rabbits that come after you are wearing the three-green-light Splinter Cell headsets. There are a set of music games where you move to the beat along with \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" and other pop songs. There's a few costumes to unlock and a few songs for your \"jukebox\", but the game is really about getting all of the mini-games unlocked so you can play them in standalone mode by yourself or with others. That really turns this into a great party game, especially with some of the humor involved. While this is clearly aimed at kids with its non-violence and cute humor, many of the younger set will find themselves frustrated with the gameplay. The \"bunnies in the outhouse\" stands out as a mission that requires a lot of work to get through, as you have to both shake the nunchuck wildly and point carefully with the controller. It does best if you have a friend to help you out. Many of the games here require so much arm movement that you can easily wear yourself out if you have to replay them too many times. The restriction on playing this all day long might not be others who want the tv - it might be that your arms give out even though you want to keep playing! I suppose in one way that helps to ensure that kids don't play it for hours on end. Their arms won't last that long :) But that being said, I do feel a few games here are just too tough for their target audience. They'll need mom or dad to help out to get through those levels. Which is fine if mom and dad are the caring, game playing types - but could be really frustrating if they are told to just get through it on their own.</td><td>Great Motion Game but Might be Tough for Small Kids</td><td>1166140800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>216619</td><td>4.0</td><td>24</td><td>false</td><td>12 12, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B003S2SQFS</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Biggest Loser Ultimate Workout Kinect lets you do a full body workout without balancing on boards or holding any controllers. You simply do the workout - and the camera knows how well you're doing. We have the PS3, XBox 360 and Wii, and we have fitness games for all of them. I was a big fan of WiiFit when it first came out. I loved the activities and saw the potential. But holding the controllers or trying to balance on the board wasn't always the best way to do an exercise. Now, with the Kinect, being active has become completely natural! You're not pushing buttons or keeping track of where your foot is. You simply follow the commands. Jumping jacks. Lunges. Yoga poses. Punching bags. You can choose Bob or Jillian to guide you, and you are in different locations for your activities. It's fairly clear that this was their first try at a Kinect game. The controls are *awful*. You have to choose your weight one pound at a time. Multiple people here tried their auto-sizer and came up with 200 inch necks. Changing values is simply not up to par compared with any other game on the market. You shouldn't be moving a tenth of a pound at a time - give us a spinner for each digit! When you input your \"additional calories\" you did (for example if you went for a 2 hour walk and want to add that into your account for tracking purposes) you have to scroll a digit at a time. So these issues aren't a one-time-only setup issue. You'll hit them every day as you try to keep your account up to date. Also, they seem to cap out at 2 hours of exercise! What if you go play golf for 4 hours? Or go hiking for an afternoon? Many of the areas are laid out with empty mats. This is so, if you have online friends, you can play with them. However, if you're playing alone it just makes the area look barren and empty. They should reduce it to just the number of players' mats.  Also, despite the fact that the camera could see our feet fine for the various exercises, when we did planks in the exact same area, it couldn't handle the plank visuals well and gave us not-perfect scores there. So there are some issues with the sensitivity. My biggest issue, though, is with the gameplay when you choose Jillian. My boyfriend likes Bob and went through his workthroughs just fine, with Bob cheering him on and explaining the moves. Then it was my turn. I chose Jillian as my trainer - and Bob's voice started talking! The most I got out of Jillian was an occasional \"good job\" - but it was Bob doing all the commentary. If I had wanted Bob, I would have chosen him. If this was going to be a Bob-centric game, they should have let us know that.  Would it really have been that hard to record some more dialogue? Still, it's important to keep in mind that this is a release title for the new Kinect system. Undoubtedly there are all sorts of kinks for game makers to work out as they figure out how to best utilize this new camera software. They'll have to tweak the way sensors work, the way you manipulate the settings and so on. Once you get into an actual workout, it is fun, and they are good about offering you water breaks and asking for audio status updates. You yell out if you're doing well or need a break, so it doesn't interrupt the gameplay. But that brings up another issue. With the Kinect, if you stand with your left hand down and out at a 45 degree angle, this is a sign to pause the Kinect. However, several of the exercises require you to put your hands into this position, and you have to wiggle to keep the Kinect from pausing! So again, a sign that this is a new-release game where they didn't think of some of those types of issues. Still, if you mentally gear yourself up to deal with some annoyances in inputting numbers and handling on-the-floor poses, there's a great deal of potential with this game. I think when they come out with the second version that they'll have fixed many of these niggling issues and have a superb game that will be great fun for years! Rating: 8/10 We purchased this game with our own money from a gaming store.</td><td>Great Exercise with a Few Issues</td><td>1292112000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>home</td><td>851197</td><td>5.0</td><td>643</td><td>true</td><td>12 12, 2007</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000UUBCNO</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>We have two Roombas plus a Scooba in our house. When one of the batteries on one of our Roombas finally reached the end of its life cycle, we decided to donate that Roomba to a friend and to get ourselves the new top of the line - the Roomba 560. We got this right when it first came out, but we waited several months before posting a review. It's pretty much impossible to review one of these Roombas after only a few days! It takes weeks if not months to start to see how well they last over time, and what breaks down. Believe me - been there, done that. So now it's many months later, and I have to say, we are quite pleased with the improvements of this Roomba over the previous generations of Roombas. So first, for those who don't even have ANY Roomba yet (hard to believe!). Roombas are awesome. We have cats, and we work from home so we're home all day. It is AMAZING how much dirt and dust and junk collects in the carpet every single day. Who really has time to vacuum their carpets twice a day any more? With the Roomba, you set the scheduler to do it while you are asleep. You wake up in the morning, the carpets are clean, the air is fresh, and you empty out the dust bin. It is just wonderful. Even those without pets might be amazed how much lint and such the Roomba will find every morning for you. I have a noise meter and have done several tests with the noise meter. The Roomba is much quieter than other regular vacuums. It is NOT silent - it can't be! How could it vacuum up dirt and be silent? But it is quieter than the alternatives, and heck, you're sleeping anyway. I can easily sleep through a Roomba running. Now, on to the improvements of this new Roomba over previous models. First, it has a cool feature where the speed drops when it senses it is approaching a solid object. The old Roomba would just run full tilt into an object - wall, couch etc. - and then turn around. This one slows down so that it hits the object gently. Sure the old Roomba wouldn't dent the walls with its powerful force, but still, it's nice to have it be gentle on furniture and your building. Next, for better or for worse, the new Roomba is much more aware of when its bin and brushes are getting grungy. I admit I didn't clean my other Roombas as often as I should have. And it led to problems. This new Roomba will actually stop and warn you when it's getting full and when the brushes should be cleaned. If you're a procrastinator like I am, this is a good thing. If you're a clean freak that empties the bin every time, and cleans the brushes every time, then you probably won't even notice this feature. The anti tangle technology is nice. The previous Roomba would start to eat a cord and just keep going until it was really stuck. This Roomba at least tries to get itself untangled. Still, I don't recommend leaving cords and strings and things lying around. You're just asking for trouble if you do. The new system uses a \"lighthouse\" instead of just a wall. With a lighthouse, you mark out a room so the Roomba finishes with that room completely before going on to the next room. They are like section markers. We tend to just use walls, but if you have two large rooms the lighthouse feature might be really helpful for you. After several months of running we have had NO problems at all with our Roomba. No broken brushes, no falling off pieces, nothing. It is still going strong and we are very pleased with it. Highly, highly recommended! I am happy to give personal advice and I even have videos of Roombas on my website. I love Roombas, they have saved me countless hours of work, and they make my home a much cleaner and easier-breathing place to be.</td><td>A Worthy Successor to the Roomba Line</td><td>1197417600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>248833</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>12 1, 2011</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0053BG26C</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Just Dance 3 for the Wii solely tracks a single controller in one hand while you dance along to a collection of songs. As simple as it might sound, it's actually quite a lot of fun! I've played and enjoyed many dance games over the years. I still have a PS2 set up in the basement with a bunch of Dance Dance Revolution games, to play with those. We also have Kinect and a PS3 move. Each system has its benefits and flaws. The DDR games of course only care about foot stomping. Kinect can see your entire body, and doesn't need you to hold anything! This Wii game falls somewhere in the middle. You dance with your whole body, but the sensor is only in one hand, so it has no idea what the rest of you is doing. On one hand I like how they have each dancer and scene customized to the song. A 50s-feel song (Crazy Little Thing Called Love) has a pair of kids dancing at a drive-in. Boogie Wonderland has a quartet of boogie-dressed dancers doing choreographed moves. You've got an undersea mermaid, \"Respect\" complete with 60s landscape, and much more. It really is quite fun, and the characters movements are incredibly smooth, too. Each song even has dance moves appropriate to the song and era. You don't have random clapping / kicking / etc. that happens to be in time with the music. The moves really do \"feel\" like they would go with the song and era. I'm also appreciative that the load times are quick. So many times when you're playing a dance game you have to wait 1-2 minutes between songs, which gets frustrating very quickly. Here it's nice and quick moving from song to song. They have a great range of songs, so that young kids will find songs they like, and adults will have some as well. So there's a lot of good. What's the flaws? First, as mentioned, all the game senses is a single arm. They don't even have you holding a controller in each hand. So the game only knows what one arm is doing. Next, I wish they at least gave you a few options amongst era-appropriate characters. Maybe different colors of skin and hairstyles. Most importantly, though, the screen layout is not optimal. You have your character in the middle that you're supposed to match. You have a small shape in the bottom left which sometimes - but not always - tells you what to do next - you have to interpret its rather cryptic clues. Then you have an indicator in the top left which lets you know if you did an action well or poorly. It can be frustrating the first few times through a song because you have practically no idea what to do and you can't watch everything at once to know how you're doing. So it's important to know that up front. Expect a learning curve for each song. You'll have to watch it a few times to figure it out and get the hang of it. Then once you can do the dance simply from memory, you can mostly watch the top left indicator to know if you did each move well enough to count. I also wish they offered more feedback on WHY you didn't get a perfect score. Other games have a variety of ways to do that which is quite helpful. Here you're sort of on your own. Still, the game is a ton of fun, a great way to stay healthy and boost your mood. It can be played alone or with friends. Well recommended! We purchased this game with our own funds.</td><td>Quite Fun</td><td>1322697600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>38817</td><td>5.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>12 1, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006JBS7</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>ToeJam and Earl III for the XBox is a great game for funk-loving teenagers, and even features a naughty/nice setting so younger kids can play too! You're in control of three funky space aliens who love funk music. There's the slim, hip DJ ToeJam, the portly, upbeat Earl, and their female sassy chick Latisha. All three have unique personalities and really get along well together, while poking fun at each other too. The general plot is about as meaningful as any other capture-coins-and-solve-quests game, which means not much at all :). It's very similar to Spyro. You start out in a \"world\" (The Grassy Zone) with a look. In this case everything is grassy and green. From there you gather keys and go into sub-worlds, each with its own keys to collect, items to gather, enemies to \"funkify\". Your ultimate aim is to find all of the funk albums that were lost by your leader. The graphics are great. Each character has his or her own moves, and is nicely 3D rendered. The worlds through which they jump, swim, fly and crawl are great. The trees in the grassy land are different from each other and look like trees. The water ripples. The city streets of the Urban Zone have graffiti on them and have street lights and other objects. The sky cycles from day to night. It's very well done! Combat is great, too. You're not actually \"killing\" things, unlike Spyro and other similar games. Instead, you're trying to \"funkify\" all these poor musically-inept humans! You run after them blasting them with your funk rays and notes, and eventually they get a shining disco ball over their head indicating that they now appreciate funk music. It is TOOOO funny! Add in to that the wicked sense of humor the characters have. Note again that there is that nice-naughty setting. So if kids are playing, the comments are pretty tame. \"Why don't you have a mouth?\", one girl asks TJ. \"I wanna be just like you, Latisha\" says another. Each player's comments are unique, and they say different things to different people. Some are hilarious! Even the naughty setting isn't \"bad\", it's just a little risque. We've played this game both with adults and kids and everyone has loved it. Get with the funk, and get your own copy!</td><td>Great Spyro-ish gameplay in a Funky world!</td><td>1038700800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>32267</td><td>3.0</td><td>9</td><td>false</td><td>11 9, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00005YDNZ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Crazy Taxi 3 might have seemed like an awesome, whatever-you-want driving game if only GTA3 and GTA: Vice City had not come along. Against Vice City, Crazy Taxi 3 seems like a small mini-game. Crazy Taxi 3 does have nice graphics, as you drive through 3 cities that approximate San Francisco, Las Vegas and New York City. Each city has its own personality, and you get to choose from a handful of taxis (and drivers) for each city. In essence you grab a fare and have to take the fare to their destination. You rack up cash for doing so and the more fares in a row you can do, the better. There are also an assortment of minigames like 'jump through the flaming hoops' and 'pop the balloons'. It this had come out say 3 years ago, the driving-whereever-you-want would have been amazing. The fact that you could just cruise the streets, plowing over sidewalks, taking shortcuts and looking at the nice graphics would have been great. Unfortunately for CT3, something else came along - Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto HAS taxi missions, with the same earnings and time limits. But in GTA, that is but one tiny part of a huge gameplay system. And when you don't feel like doing timed missions, you have the luxury of driving anywhere you want, in any car you want, and exploring the world you have. You can say that GTA3/GTAVC is for the PS2 and Crazy Taxi 3 is for the XBox. But what does that mean? That because they were programming for the XBox, Crazy Taxi 3's developers could only put out 1/20th of the game?  At least if they were going to solely concentrate on taxi-like things, they could have put in more cities, or more taxis, or more missions, or something. But the game comes across as an arcade port (which it was) that didn't have a lot of energy behind it (unfortunately). What they put out as a 'complete game' is something the Grand Theft guys kicked out as a fun little side toy. I am a HUGE HUGE fan of arcade games, and also a HUGE fan of driving games, so I really had high hopes for this. But unfortunately the game turned mindlessly repetitive too quickly. I'm disappointed that the PS2 has the Vice City/GTA3 shining as their 'driving in a city' showoff and that the XBox can only hold this up as a comparison. It's time for the XBox developers to take the brilliance behind Halo and show us that they CAN have a Vice City like incredible experience on their platform.

Now you can adopt a cute kitten or puppy, or even get budgies, lovebirds, turtles, iguanas and goldfish! There are all sorts of accessories that come with the pets, too. There are different sizes of cages for the birds, a fishbowl of course for the fish. There are lizard cages and turtle cages. For the dogs and cats, there are climbing toys, squeeze toys, food dishes of various sizes, and an assortment of sleeping containers. You can go with the inexpensive curl-up spot to the deluxe canopied princess bed. The birds and reptiles are just bought \"as is\", but when you buy your puppy or kitten you can choose its gender and from 15 different types. For cats, go from siamese to striped to minx with no tail. For the dogs, you can get 101 dalmatians, or maybe a terrier is more your style? The web also offers many, many other skin types if your favorite breed doesn't come with the software. The pets are GREAT. The cats hunt mice, the dogs learn to sit and stay. You can play with your parakeets, taking them out on your finger. I have 3 parakeets at home and they chirp like wild when the budgies come on the screen! So the sounds are definitely very good. In addition to the pets, this expansion also offers five new careers - education, fashion, circus, culinary and animal care. You can grow food in your garden if you wish, and there are new places to visit in town, including a pet show to show off your new friends. But the highlight of course are the pets. You can't control them - you just interact with them. But the interaction can be quite fun. Before you know it, other neighborhood pets will be wandering by to say hello!

Red Faction II takes this technology a step further and enhances the graphics as well. Where Red Faction was set on Mars, and you were a miner fighting against a corrupt mining company, Red Faction II is set on Earth and you (named 'Alias') are fighting against SOPOC. SOPOC is very '70s Soviet' like with lots of thick accents and heavy [politics]. Again, the geomod technology really shines in the game. Just about anything you see, you can shoot off the outer layer and even blow the entire object up. An enemy is blocking the end of a hallway? Blow a hole in the wall nearby and go around the back way. Want to take down a bridge? Blow out the supports beneath it and then put grenades in the exposed core. The game bills itself as team-based combat, but it isn't nearly as smooth as Halo. You do have one or two friends that fight alongside you in certain areas, or who pipe in on your communications system to give you suggestions. In generaly though it's really you against the enemy. You can act as gunner in several missions, and there are one or two that you can steer a given vehicle in. The graphics are good, but not stellar. The lighting is nice as spotlights shine down in the dark or lights glow overhead, but it's still a bit flat when compared against the top of the line console or PC games.  The music is OK, but a lot of the 'immersion' things you watch for - footsteps, shadows, ambient noises - are missing. You can probably get through the game in a few days, and once you unlock various features with bonus achievements you can have a blast (heh) in the various deathmatch and multiplay modes. Eventually you can use all the models you encounter in multiplayer, plus a wide variety of weapons, maps and situations. If you're a fan of shoot-em-up gameplay that sometimes needs a bit of thought behind how to achieve the objective, this is the game for you. You can replay each mission several times to see if alternate routes through walls, floors or ceilings make a difference. The graphics aren't perfect, but the geomod technology gives them a leg up on the competition. Once they get the graphics to shine like some of the top-runners in the market, they will be unbeatable!</td><td>GeoMod is GREAT, but a bit too short</td><td>1036800000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>36597</td><td>4.0</td><td>9</td><td>false</td><td>11 8, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006C28W</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>TimeSplitters was a popular game when it came out. It took the normal shooter game and added in changes in environment - you moved through time to persue your enemies. TimeSplitters 2 expands this with better graphics, sound, and multiplay features. The plot isn't much to get enthusiastic about. An evil enemy race is trying to wipe out humanity, and they have a time portal. They run back through time with crystals and you have to go back into each time period to track down the crystal and do other miscellaneous tasks while you're there. The graphics are indeed nice, from flaming torches to dreary sewers and polished marble floors. But when you compare them to the likes of Halo or Kingdom Hearts, they're a bit old looking. There aren't shadows. The backgrounds aren't very dynamic. You shoot walls and get tiny holes, unlike the deformable terrain of other current games. The textures seem flat and a bit repetitive. They did make an attempt to have the sounds match the eras, with lovely chanting during Notre Dame and twanging during the Western era. Even so, you don't feel 'immersed' in the game. Characters don't make noise when they walk. There isn't really any ambient noise. The weapon choices are fun and time-appropriate. In Chicago of 1932, you've got Tommy Guns. In Notre Dame you're playing with shotguns. So there's always new variety as you go from level to level. The missions aren't very challenging compared to other games that are out. They are extremely linear and there's rarely any brainpower involved. There's side missions like \"blow up file cabinets along the way\" or \"shoot out whiskey barrels\". There's usually a rationale given but it's pretty flimsy. There are other 'mini-games' that you can play. Do things like fight off the living dead, smash the glass and so on. Try to get the best times to get high rankings. Where the game really shines is multiplayer. There are HUNDREDS of characters to choose from in multiplay, and tons of ways to play that you unlock as you go. There are the standards like deathmatch as well as more interesting variations. The game is savvy about game hook-ups and LANs to open the game up to as many players as possible for your system. In addition, TimeSplitters 2 comes with a MAP EDITOR.

It only outputs 480. But this lets you plug your Wii into a HDMI plug at that quality level. So, why would you want to do this? The first answer is that many TVs use primarily HDMI plugs. So by doing this your Wii uses a standard HDMI plug like all your other devices do. You don't have to worry about old style plugs any more. If you have a multi-HDMI switching unit, it means you can easily switch between your various inputs with the push of a button. You don't have to worry about moving between multiple types of cables. In our case, we have an \"input\" button for our TV that cycles through the available input options. If we had our Wii plugged into the TV - **even if the Wii was turned off** - then every time we cycled through our input options it would stop at the Wii choice and say there was no signal. It was a royal pain to have that in the loop for no reason at all. With HDMI, the system is far smarter. It won't show an option if the unit is not turned on. In addition, we now have a three-to-one HDMI intelligent converter for our three HDMI games (the Wii, plus our PS3 and XBox 360). So now all three game consoles go into one cable and that cable goes into the TV. It smart-switches so whichever one is on feeds the signal. That way there's far less clutter and a much easier set of controls to manage. Is the signal any \"better\"? Again, the Wii is by its nature only 480. It cannot get any better than that. But that being said, the HDMI converter does do an attempt to \"refine\" the signal as it goes to the TV, to make it crisper and more vibrant. I do notice a subtle difference.

Really, over 20,000 objects apparently populate your instant-creation list.  This is a 2D sidescroller game, and your quest in each level is to get to the star. There are, of course obstacles. Let's say the star is on a high ledge that you can't jump to. You simply write \"ladder\" and POOF a ladder appears. You climb up the ladder. Done! If there's a pile of dirt you type \"shovel\" to create a shovel and dig. If there's a fish to catch, you type \"fishing pole\". There's no one way to solve any puzzle. I had a star that fell onto a spike and got damaged. I typed \"igloo\" to put an igloo over the spike. The star slid safely off the igloo and was fine! Your creativity is really challenged. Especially because you earn points for re-solving levels in different ways. It's not a big surprise, but in a game with this kind of innovative undertaking there are all sorts of annoying problems. Take ladders. Ladders for some reason do not work sturdily. They wobble and fall. Placing objects on the screen is often an exercise in frustration. I had an angry dog to get past. I made a leash and put it on the dog. So far so good. Then I tried *all* sorts of objects to connect the other end of the leash too. The dog would just drag them along. They wouldn't stick in the ground. If I tried to hammer a spike in the ground, I \"attacked\" the spike instead. I could make tranquilizer, but not use it on the dog. Often in these levels you get frustrated and just make a bear and take care of the dog (or other creature) in a hostile way - but I don't like to do that. The camera controls are really frustrating as well. You can scroll to look around the level, but it instantly snaps back to your main character. I would like the camera to simply go where I want it to go. There is a level editor in here, which is a fun idea, and there are a ton of different situations to try, so there is no dearth of things to figure out. The problem is you have to feel excited to try them all. Once you start getting frustrated by the game, it's almost a chore to pick it up and struggle with the next one. An awesome concept. I really give them the highest marks for making such an open-ended game. I love the ability to have your main character be a bride and other characters, too. But the basic problems with the objects you make, and the camera through which you view your world, knock off a point for me. I give this a very low 4/5, and really hope they make a sequel that handles the objects much better.</td><td>So much potential - a low 4/5 rating</td><td>1257552000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>92751</td><td>5.0</td><td>21</td><td>false</td><td>11 7, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000I4JJRI</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I loved Guitar Hero. I thought it was fantastic. Guitar Hero II is even better! Great songs, great gameplay, quite addictive. A must buy :) So first, how this game works. You have a special controller that looks like a guitar. If you have one from Guitar Hero (I), it will work so you won't have to buy another one. You get 5 buttons on the fret (the thin part on the left) and then a \"push\" toggle in the center of the guitar. So you're hammering down strings on the fretboard by pressing colored buttons, and you're \"strumming\" by pushing down on the toggle in the guitar's center. It's actually quite fun, although \"real\" guitar players have a fit because the notes are of course not in the right place and when they try to really play the song, it doesn't work properly. But back to our fun air guitar playing :) They have a fantastic blend of songs on this. The intriguing part of any music game is finding songs that every single person likes. I imagine it's impossible. There are songs on here that I dislike that I'm sure other people love. Then again they have \"Surrender\" and \"Message in a Bottle\" which I find amazingly fun to play, which I'm sure some people hate with a passion. Hopefully there's a middle ground here! The game moves you from club to club, and you have to pass 3 out of 4 songs at each club to move along. You go through some classic locations like the Rat Celler in Boston. You get to choose your character from a number of pre-sets (both male and female, hurrah!!) and even choose your guitar. The songs get trickier as you progress. When you unlock songs in career mode you can then play them whenever you want in the casual playing mode both for one or two players. It's great fun to rock out with a friend with the music blasting! Then there's always going back to get perfect scores - and increasing the difficulty to get to special songs that the Easy People can't see. The graphics are pretty good - but really, when your fingers are flying and you're trying to push the buttons in super-fast-time (that's a musical term), how can you possibly even see what those on screen characters are doing in the background? That's more to entertain whoever is watching you. Still, I like that the audience waves lighters during the quiet parts of songs :) If I have a complaint, it's the same complaint I had with the first one - that sometimes their prompts show up OVER THE FRET BOARD so you can't see what the upcoming notes are! Surely some of the testers must have realized this - or were the testers all so glazed at that point that they knew the songs by heart and weren't having to look at the screen? Still, it's a minor issue. Definitely a game to get, that is great fun for anybody who loves rock music! Here are the songs you begin with, to whet your appetite! Shout at the Devil / Mother / Surrender / Woman / Strutter / Heart-Shaped Box / Message in a Bottle / You Really Got Me / Monkey Wrench / Them Bones / Search and Destroy / Tattooed Love Boys / Cherry Pie / Who Was In My Room Last Night? / Girlfriend / Can't You Hear Me Knockin'</td><td>Fantastic Fun - a Must if you Love Rock Music</td><td>1162857600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>46471</td><td>4.0</td><td>43</td><td>false</td><td>11 6, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00009OWKQ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Magic The Gathering Battlegrounds is NOT a card game translated to the XBox. It is a fighting game that is based on the environments and creatures found in the Magic world. You can choose from various characters, each representing a different style of world. The demo only has 2 worlds represented, but the actual game has 6. Each has his own look and selection of spells and creatures. The training mode walks you through the basics. You are in essence on a battleground split in half. You can only cast spells on your half of the battleground, and if you stay in your enemy's half for too long you take damage. You gather up mana to cast spells, and the more mana you get, the more powerful spells you can cast. Some spells create creatures which either attack your enemy or sit still and defend you. Some spells attack your enemy and his creatures. Other spells give enhancements to your own creatures. Unlike other fighting games, this isn't just about 'attacking blindly until he's dead'. You have to balance your spell usage between defending your own body, creating creatures, enhancing your creatures and taking out your enemy and his creatures. Since the mana supply is not copious, exactly how you balance your mana can make the difference between survival and death. The quest mode lets you learn new spells and abilities, and practice your skills. The actual combat mode is where you move forward in the rankings. The game is XBox live enabled (tho the demo is not) which should be the real key to this game. Sure, it's fun to play against computer generated characters - but the real joy will be taking your well-trained character and setting him against the world of other gamers, and seeing how well you rank in that world. The graphics are rather good, and I really felt like my characters and I were a \"team\" working together to defeat an enemy. The game isn't complex in the \"advanced RPG\" way nor do the battles involve multiple button-mashing sequences like, say, Mortal Combat. Instead, it is a fast paced strategy game that exercises your mind as much as it does your fingers, and the winner will truly be the person who is the best rounded in ALL areas.</td><td>Great strategy and fighting too</td><td>1068076800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>home</td><td>622765</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>11 4, 2015</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000JENUOA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I run a wine site and I burn through corkscrew worms like you would not believe.

As the name would suggest, the sniping is the centerpiece of the game, with factors like bullet drop, wind, and distance all playing a major factor. However, the sniping process has been greatly simplified to be more accessible to the majority of players. For example, on most difficulty modes there will be a red dot that shows up while aiming to show where your bullet will go. Additionally, it is possible to hold your breath (which is essentially a slow-mo aiming mechanic) for a better shot. The stealth aspect of the game is kind of neat. By staying in bushes and using silenced weapons, it's possible to keep enemies confused about your location. Once in actual combat, you can hold your own with grenades and pistols (or by picking up an enemy rifle), but you can't take much punishment, which prevents Rambo-esque fighting. Hiding isn't exactly perfect, but you have a general meter to indicate if enemies can see your or are suspicious. Detecting enemies is sort of weird - sometimes they'll be highlighted on your map, in which case you can see where they are and the direction they're looking in, while other times they'll be unmarked and you'll have to detect them through sight and sound (both of which are fairly limited). Unlike, say, Metal Gear Solid 3, it never actually feels that tense; if someone spots you, it's generally out of your control, because listening for things like footsteps is extremely haphazard. All you can really do is hide in the bushes and hope for the best. My main complaint with the game, though, is that it's less about finding a good sniping spot and taking a long shot, and more about linear paths that you have to sneak/snipe your way through. There are some opportunities to set up good shots, but most of the game is closer to close-range combat. The graphics are pretty nice, with the most obvious \"show-off\" feature being the bullet cam that you get for particularly good shots (mostly headshots). After you click the mouse to fire, the camera jumps to a slow-mo view of your bullet and follows it into the body of the unlucky enemy you targeted. It's pretty rewarding, even after you've seen it a lot. It's especially good after a really long shot, since you get to watch the bullet travel that whole distance. \"Sniper: Ghost Warrior\" isn't a bad game, but at parts it seems too focused on action gameplay. It's got a pretty cool dynamic, but the need for huge numbers of enemies (Hollywood-style) sort of makes it less interesting on that front. The shooting mechanic was simplified to make up for this, as well. As FPS games go, it's pretty neat, but it's not that in-depth.

This volume is probably because many schools have the book as required reading, but it still shows just how important and powerful this book is in modern times. Written back in 1948, the book was primarily a warning against the communism of Soviet Russia and what that style of government could do to society. Many of the phrases and images in the book have become part of our culture. We expect people to understand what Big Brother means when we refer to it. We talk about the thought police. If only to be able to understand modern conversation and references, this is a book to have familiarity with, just as having at least a passing knowledge of events in the Bible will help you understand references in culture to 40 days and 40 nights of floods, gathering animals up two by two, and so on. But aside from its position as a foundation of certain phrases in society, how does the book stand as an actual story? As with most fables, it is very heavy handed. There are few shades of grey in this book. The government is Evil. Evil, Evil, Evil. They delight in being evil. The people are completely helpless and know this. They march around in their dingy lives, watching as things get progressively worse, and knowing they cannot do anything to change it. Their life is going to suck, and then they are going to die. Even if they break the rules to grab momentary happiness, they know that this is doomed. They will be found out eventually. It is impressive that a writer in the late 40s was able to come up with some of the technology that he did, the pervasive ability of the government to watch and scan everybody. The ability for a power (government, media, educational institutions) to mold the human mind subtly had already been shown over the centuries in a variety of situations, so that was less of a stretch. Go to any corporation, any university, and you'll find indoctrination being done at many levels, usually for good cause. Building school spirit by uniting against a classic foe is all in fun - but that ability to build up hate so easily gives one pause. On the other hand, Orwell missed out on the power of massive computer networks. With the advent of TV and the Internet, viewers have the luxury of multiple information sources. This is something unprecedented in our history. Back in medieval days, you only knew what your local priest told you as far as news went. Most people could not read, and few traveled. Even in South Africa before apartheid was abolished they refused to bring in TVs, for fear that the population would be able to learn about life outside their own lands. That isolation is almost impossible in modern times. With a computer, you can gain access to news sources from around the world - both commercial and personal. You can hear, from people in Sudan, what life is like there. Even in countries like China where they attempt to control access to certain sites, there is always a way out, to find out from different sources what is going on. The book is still of course a cautionary tale, a warning of allowing any particular power to go too far. It is a look into the way human emotions can be manipulated, and how a society can be pressed down. However, it's important to remember this is a fable, a deliberate Bleak! Despair! Death! overly cynical view of things. In reality, we have seen *many* societies who were pressed down, and who successfully rebelled. Mankind is far more resiliant than portrayed here. SPOILER ALERT A key scene in the book involves the lead character's betrayal of his loved one. First he is tortured for months and months, something which makes little sense in any realistic viewing of these events. It is actually brought up by the character as being silly, and a throw-away answer is given. If the government actually spent this much time and effort feeding and torturing every single person who committed a crime, there would be no workers left. It is a plot device to ratchet up the tension in the story. The tension reaches its climax with a specific torture - the character is going to have a cage of rats attached to his head. This is, of course, his Worst Fear. To evade it, he asks that the box be put on his girlfriend instead. At this great betrayal, his heart is shattered. That this was some incredible failing that should have shattered his spirit does not make sense. Every human body has limits of emotional and physical pain. As much as we might value pride, honor, loyalty, love, or whatever else we hold dear, there will always be a point at which we will break. Knights who trained from birth to live a life of honor could be forced to confess if tortured for long enough. That is why things like cyanide pills exist in spy novels. Still, even though those parts of the story always nag at me when I read it, I do find the general lessons the book tries to convey to be quite important ones, and for that reason I definitely count this as a book that every adult should have read at least once.</td><td>A Foundation for Many Modern Phrases</td><td>1164844800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>home</td><td>988101</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>11 3, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0013IDHTO</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>One of the greatest challenges in eating healthily involves really knowing what you are eating.

As a first person shooter it has an OK single player mission series, but the game really shines in its on line tournament play. Yes, there is a single player mode. You go around shooting things, learning about the weapons and maps. Play with the six races and various classes to learn which best appeals to you and your gameplay style. The character choices are interesting, and the sound draws you into the game. The booming wrestling-match commands give you that tournament feel. On the down side, there is a lot of cursing in the default taunts, so this is yet another reason the game isn't great for younger kids (apart from the obvious violence). The graphics and physics are truly amazing. They've gone an excellent job both with indoor and outdoor maps. Players who are used to the Doom-like graphics of some other games out there will really appreciate the attention to detail put into the development here.  The way in which your character moves, and the world through which you are moving, are both very realistic. The weapons represent a good mix of styles. Some might complain that some of the uber-weapons from previous releases are missing - but there's a reason for that, it's called gameplay balance. The weapon set you have available here helps ensure that you have to use some brains and strategy to win, not just raw button-mashing ability. Where the game really shines is multiplayer. This is what it was made for. Once you've spent enough time in single player to learn the controls, races and weapons, be sure to head on line! You can play classics like deathmatch, capture the flag, bombing run (like football) and domination (a control-area setup).

Trauma Center is like an online, graphic version of that - with puzzles, too. You need fast fingers and a sharp mind to save your patients. You're in the future, and you begin with simple operations. Repairing broken bones, stitching up cuts. You use your Wii controller in the right hand to point at the various items, and the nunchuck in your left to select the tools. It's really quite intuitive, although it requires you to hold the controller like a pencil for pinpoint accuracy, and this can get really tough on your hand, really quickly. You need a super steady hand to pull off some of the moves. Then the game goes into futuristic mode and now you are trying to zap moving creatures that are crawling around inside people. There isn't any blood or gore - even \"drain the blood\" only has fuzzy red areas. Parents don't have to worry at all about upsetting young tykes from this point of view. Even I, who am normally squeamish about blood, didn't have any issues here. The worst was perhaps using the scalpel to slice open the flesh and see it open up into a red wound. But again, it was very tame, just a red inside on a tan body. The issue for me is that I would have loved for the game to be more realistic from a medical point of view. They love throwing around complex words in this game, to give it a hospital feel, but then they get some basic anatomy wrong that even I realize! Part of the fun of watching shows like CSI is that you are learning something as you go. Here, you are getting inaccurate information, which is a real shame. Also, while the realistic episodes such as \"get the arm bones back together\" are very satisfying, it's much more odd when you're tracking down moving \"enemy objects\" inside a person. I would really have loved many more complex, real life situations. Medical operations are tense and complex enough on their own without having to throw in unnecessarily silly items to jazz it up. Speaking of tense and silly, the game intersperses your doctoral duties with a soap opera of cut scenes. These involve stationary images of people shown on the screen, while a hyper voice babbles in the background. It's bad enough when these happen before a mission, getting you riled up and worried about your patient. It's far worse when you are IN an open chest wound, trying frantically to pull out the shards of glass or whatever, and your nurse barges in with inane babble, that you have to deliberately click to \"hear\" and continue with! Also, I think they could have done a better job of laying out the HUD. Part of your screen is taken up with an image of your nurse or other person, which is of course completely unnecessary. The pulse line, showing the health of your patient, is of course critical to the operation but is very hard to keep a handle on when you're in the thick of things. Half the time your nurse only warns you about a danger when it is too late to do anything about it. So you have to either keep looking up there yourself or have a friend watch it for you, calling out when it begins to drops. Just about every other game out there has some sort of a health line / bar and handles it better. Finally, especially for a kid's game, they are a little harsh on the consequences. If you do something wrong, the game could say \"Another doctor stepped in to save the patient, and you decided to be a nurse instead\". Something that indicated failure but not catastrophic emotional trauma. Instead, they talk about the patient dying, you quitting your job in despair, your life being ruined because of this one mistake. Most people play these games to release stress, not to feel like they have destroyed a person's life because they didn't zig-zag their sutures quite right. My boyfriend got hooked on this and played it straight through in about 3 days, playing maybe 5 hours a day. So in that sense it's relatively short, although of course you an go back and re-play it to get the highest score on each of the levels. I do want to comment here that the soundtrack got MADDENINGLY annoying after a while. It's pretty much the same. DUM DUM DUM DUMMMMM! The music is like watching a  soap opera hospital scene, where you sense impending doom every ... second ... of ... the ... time ... The nurse is screaming out \"Doctor! What is that?!?!?\" I realize they want to get your adrenaline going, but there's such a thing as overkill. If you turn off the music, though, you lose the few indicators you do get about the patient's health. I really would have liked an option to have just \"medical sounds\" playing - alerts for the health, that sort of thing - and be able to have silence otherwise. Still, the game is fun to play and very intruging in concept. I would *love* to play a sequel to this. Again, my suggestions would be to remove the annoying cut-scenes (at least mid-operation!), give options to remove the music and super-hyper-unprofessional sidekicks, and to have more realistic scenarios. I think this could become a must-have title if they headed that way.</td><td>Appropriate for Kids, Quite Fun</td><td>1164672000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>67298</td><td>5.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>11 27, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009O7HVM</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Star Wars Battlefront II is a great sequel to a wonderful game. Numerous game balance issues have been remedied, and new features bring interesting challenges. First, the basic premise. This game is all about massive scale battles on pretty much any location thought of in the Star Wars universe. You can run around the streets of Tattoine, jumping from sandstone building to building, mowing down rebel forces. You can explore Hoth, fighting off the snow. Even the meteorite featured for a few seconds when Padme gave birth is here. With this wealth of locations, you also get a huge selection of unit types. There are traditional stormtroopers, snowtroopers, sandtroopers. You get jawas and tuskan raiders.  You can even play as a jedi for a short period of time, to give your team an edge. There are all sorts of game modes to play in. There's Galactic Conquest which gives you a giant galaxy map of the planets, and you move fleets of ships across them, taking on one planet at a time. Your aim of course is to take them all over. There's cool games like capture the flag and hunt, for quick, fun gameplay. I love the fact that the world is so in depth. For example, you can be flying your shuttle in space, dodging laser bullets from other ships, with a planet spinning below. If you fly your shuttle into an enemy ship, you can actually hop out and start running around IN the ship, shooting out the troops. You can even attack the systems of the ship - like the shields and engines - to damage the ship. In the background you can see other battles going on, giving your actions an epic feel. It's important to note that this is not an EASY game. There is a lot to learn here. You can switch characters on the fly, earn points to unlock items, earn bonusses mid-game to upgrade weapons, and much more. It's really key to do the training missions and understand how this all works. The graphics are really stunning. The textures on the building, the character models, the general look and feel of each world, was clearly done with an eye to detail. The sound is equally good, providing the original sound styles from the Star Wars world to draw you in to the environment.

One is the honorable, straightforward type and the other is the rebel, whiny type. Really, it has little effect on gameplay besides the dialogue spoken and a few other situations. The plot is pretty meaningless. In essence you have to go through level after level of enemies, slaying them all with your choice of 3 weapons. One shoots straight blue beams, one shoots circular red ones, and the third shoots zig-zag green ones. You can pop between them at whim and as all have infinite ammo, you can just blast away. The sound is fine, a loop of tinny music that keeps you moving along through the missions. Sometimes you're jumping on platforms, sometimes you're running down tunnels. You spin in circles, look for enemy weak spots, and the \"GO\" arrows keep you moving in the right direction. I wish they could have had room to put an actual health bar for yourself and your enemy. Instead they show a countdown of actual digit numbers (say 100 vs 42) and you have to watch those count down to zero. Since you are often in massive 100-on-1 battles with hordes of creatures, it'd be easier to glance up at a bar vs reading a tiny number. Also, some of the backgrounds are exceedingly (and unnecessarily) busy, meaning that the character doesn't stand out very well against them. It's hard to see your character amidst all the color-jumble behind him. A game should be a challenge of skills, not a challenge of picking out the pixel-pieces that represent you. Finally, the game is REALLY short. I think they could have fit several more mission levels easily into the set, to give us more playing time. That all being said, Gunstar Super Heroes is quite a fun mindless blasting game that's easy to put down and pick up. It's perfect for playing on a bus or train ride, or while you wait around for any reason. Well recommended.</td><td>Fun Sidescroller for Casual Gameplay</td><td>1133049600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>50071</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>11 27, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000AI1KE</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>In Dead or Alive Ultimate, you get to play both Dead or Alive 1 and an improved version of Dead or Alive 2 - plus online gameplay as well! XBox fans who enjoy fighting are thrilled about this - because while Dead or Alive 3 was on the XBox, until now there was no way to play the older games on this console. The Dead or Alive 1 gameplay is just like the original, bringing the classic feel and fun. On the other hand, Dead or Alive 2 is definitely updated. You get the same characters and locations, but the graphics have been revamped to take advantage of the XBox's engine. I have to say this is GREAT because I'm a huge fan of Dead or Alive 3 and its amazing graphics. To be able to have that same level of graphic achievement - with blowing leaves, footprints in the snow, and so on - is just great. The costumes and characters are all quite distinctive and really let you get a feel for the personality of each individual. The main theme is done by Aerosmith, but each level has its own music that fits well with the scenario. You get to fight in Japanese gardens, on the Great Wall of China, in a peaceful forest, and in other quite detailed spots. Not only are the three dimensional areas visually spectacular, but you can knock a character off a given section of the map and continue the fight on lower levels. It really adds to the strategy and gameplay. There are great new scenes to help you learn more about the Dead or Alive universe. It's like reading a prequel to your favorite story - suddenly the characters and their actions take on new meanings. The online gameplay lets you take your skills and techniques online, to test against players around the world. Instead of being 'stuck' with the gameplay in the game (which can easily last for weeks), you could play 24 hours a day and never run out of new opponents to face. If I have any complaint about this game, it's that while the guys are in really cool costumes, the women all seem to be wearing costumes that clearly show off their underwear and big breasts. Some people DO play these games who aren't obsessed with women's underwear and inflatable chests. That being said, it is at least great that female fighters are treated with respect, and it's considered normal to have just as many female characters in a fighting game as males. It wasn't that long ago that a fighting game would be males only, with women stuck on the sidelines waving little flags. A great fighting game in general, and a must-have for DOA fans to fill in the storyline. 4.5/5</td><td>Great background and gameplay</td><td>1101513600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>69794</td><td>5.0</td><td>39</td><td>false</td><td>11 26, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009WPZOA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Need for Speed Most Wanted is a street racing game where the graphics really shine. You see every detail in your Porshe, Mustang, or other racecar. I've been playing a lot of this and also Project Gotham Racing 3. Both have quite highly detailed car models, with a nice selection to choose from. NFSMW shines in the area of customization. Where PGR3 gives you a few colors to choose from, in this game you can go through a giant range of color choices. Then you can customize the vinyl, and tons of stickers and other options. You can go through a mission mode where you develop the storyline and learn the characters. You can also do time trial types of challenges, as well as quick races just to have some fun. The graphics in this game are REALLY nice. First, the car models are great - from the detail of the body to the interior and lights. Next, the characters are really well done, far better than just about any other XBox 360 game I've played so far. The face textures, especially, are quite smooth and life-like. The backgrounds are also quite nice. I really like the mountains in the background, with the forest running down the sides. The sounds are reasonably good, with the dialogue being OK. Some of it seems a little silly, from the cop deciding to key your car, and the girls acting like toys. What it really comes down to, though, is having fun street racing, and customizing and choosing new cars. This game obviously isn't realistic. If you slam your car into gas station trash cans at 140mph, your car comes to an immediate stop without any damage at all to the car or the trash cans. You can drive your car down through street light after street light, leaving a trail behind you. The game's about fun fantasy. You have fun driving all of the super-expensive cars you've always wished you could buy - or perhaps you take a car you own and \"test it out\" in ways your local cops wouldn't approve of. I do have to comment that some of the cars seem a little squirrley. I've owned Mustangs since I was 18, and have done a bit of high speed driving with them. I don't recall them spinning in circles quite as easily as in the game. Still, maybe the roads in the game are a bit slick :) Well recommended for car racing lovers who are into customizing and detailing their cars! I do have to say that this game lets you race only against 3 others online, where PGR3 lets you go in a field of 8. So it might be worth it for you to get both games, as each has a different area it is truly great in.</td><td>Great Racing Game - Wonderful Customization</td><td>1132963200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>68026</td><td>4.0</td><td>70</td><td>false</td><td>11 26, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009S4UOA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Call of Duty 2 takes you into the trenches of World War II, starting with the frozen tundra of Russia under attack. High realism levels really draw you into the combat. You start out as a raw Russian recruit, in the freezing winter of Moscow, trying to learn how to use a rifle and stave off the impending Nazi take-over. You only get a few moments of training before you're sent out into combat to defend your home town. The graphics are a really nice mix of realistic scenery and helpful gameplay. Items you need will glow gold so that they're easy to find.  A compass on your display will point your way to important objectives. Your ammo, health and other indicators are easy to find. But in the meantime, your main screen graphics are really quite impressive. From the brickwork on the buildings to the smoke-grenade haze, from the uniforms on your friends and enemies, the quality on a HD TV is quite impressive. The widescreen view lets you keep an eye all around you while you move your way through hostile territory. You try to focus while you hear the screams, calls, bullet blasts and grenade booms landing all around you. It's like being in a warzone, which of course it is. Your teammates are all around you, and they do their best to help you out. Like you, many of them are raw recruits and not very good at things. As you move forward, they get more skilled, as do you. You learn how to pause before aiming, how to use cover and to approach your objective with stealth. I do wish that you could have more than 8 simultaneous players online during XBox Live. The single player games are great, but of course they don't last forever. When you get through them, the next step is to start playing online to face a \"real challenge\" with live players. The game would be SUPERB if it let you play large squad on large squad. Maybe that could come with future upgrades. Still, at least playing with 8 people lets you keep enjoying the graphics, the gameplay and the skill set. It's always far more challenging to play against live players rather than playing against a computer set. Computers are great for training, but live players are where the long term enjoyment of a game shines through. Highly recommended for war game lovers, especially those who enjoy squad-type combat. If you hook up with a team of like-minded online players, this could provide for countless months of online fun, as you face your squad against other highly skilled teams.</td><td>Great War Game Classic</td><td>1132963200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>68088</td><td>4.0</td><td>86</td><td>false</td><td>11 26, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009SQFHA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Some games are mature because they have swearing. Others are mature because they are really scary and nasty. Condemned - Criminal Origins falls clearly into the latter category. Condemned - Criminal Origins has you in the part of FBI Agent Ethan Thomas, tracking down a serial murder. Don't think that this is like Law & Order or Criminal Intent. This is about the nastiest, grittiest, scariest areas of a city that you can imagine. Somehow it's as if a maximum security prison was turned into an area of town. You go walking through buildings that are covered with gang signs, crawling with addicts who kill police offers on sight. Most of these insane bad guys lurk in the dark and call out profanities before bashing you with 2x4s or other weapons of convenience. Of course a wise police officer might call for backup. But in the first \"situation\", you're told backup will take 10 minutes to show up. Instead of hanging tight for 10 minutes, you go trekking through the building on your own with only a gun and a flashlight to keep you safe. It's not long before the gun is in the hands of the bad guy and it's you and your flashlight against numerous enemies. This is wise?? Where's your radio? You have a helpful friend - Lt. Rosa - who helps to talk you through using your forensic equipment. However, she waits until a madman almost kills you before chiming in with some information about how all the madmen on the streets are insane and worthy of slaying. Thanks for the help, Rosa. The game is definitely very scary. The screens are quite dark, the flashlight only lights up small areas, and there are a ton of corners for the madmen to hide out in. You see them run across the screen, take cover, lurk in the corners. You never know when they'll launch an assault. Again, it really makes me ask why a lone FBI guy is roaming around in here without any real weapons. I realize it's for plot reasons, but I want a better plot :) Surely if I was really tracking down a serial murderer, I'd have more backup and more weapons than this. That being said, if you're looking for a scary game that isn't all-and-all out combat a la Quake 4, this might fit the bill exactly. It's you against the enemy - and the enemy is truly insane. It's not about tons of ammo here - you're lucky if you even have a gun sometimes. You have to find crowbars, planks of wood and whatever you can to stay alive. If you play this at night, with the house quiet around you, the HD TV showing you the full detail and the 5.1 surround sound tuning you in to the slightest noise, it really can get to you. Well recommended for the mature set that enjoys being scared!</td><td>Play At Night in a Silent House - Quite Scary</td><td>1132963200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>74184</td><td>4.0</td><td>28</td><td>false</td><td>11 26, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000B6ML0A</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I really wanted to like Kameo - Elements of Power. Compared to the other release titles for the XBox 360, this one seemed relatively light and friendly. The game is a traditional action-adventure game. In this case, there is hardly any plot line. You're a female shape-shifter whose family is held hostage by your jealous older sister. You have to work your way through level after level of enemies to save them. In essence it's the classic problem of which shape fits best to which situation. Sometimes you need the ice crystal powers of Chilla, a big Yeti creature. Sometimes you need the sneak-underground powers of Pummel Weed, a plant creature. Maybe it's the rolling ball type abilities of Major Ruin that fit the need. The further you go in the game, the more creatures you can turn into. This ends up being a complex set of puzzles. You have to roll and launch yourself into the air, but then turn into a Yeti mid-air to grab onto the wall. You have to flip up the enemies as the plant, but you do better pummelling them as something more powerful. The game is cartooney, but the graphics are rather quite nice. The little flaming guys are much different in texture from the rock monsters, and the world around you has a different appearance depending on what realm you're in. We're not talking high quality modern photo-realism here, but the world is nicely rendered in its kid-like fantasy way. The game is teen rated, so this is one of the few games that you can really feel comfortable buying for a younger gamer on the XBox 360. Most of the other games invole lots of blood, lots of swearing, or both. I honestly am not sure why they called this a Teen. Yes, you're killing enemies, but heck, they're all trolls. The elves clearly should win :) The soundtrack is pretty nice, a smooth, classic style track that sings along in the background. It doesn't stand out, but it doesn't get in the way either. I'm normally a fantasy / puzzle fan, but this one seemed just a little too \"standard\" to really catch my attention. No plot, no real connection with the characters and no real development. I didn't feel a great need to \"keep playing\" any time that I put the game down. That's the only reason I gave it only 4/5. Recommended if you're into action puzzlers or have a younger gamer in the house that isn't quite ready for the raw gore of a mature title.</td><td>Fun Action - Adventure with Morphing Abilities</td><td>1132963200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>67983</td><td>4.0</td><td>42</td><td>false</td><td>11 26, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009S4UOK</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Quake has a long, infamous history as a hard-hitting first person shooter that is not afraid of gore. With the XBox 360, Quake truly steps up its attention to detail. This classic game has been around for eons. I remember the old days of Doom and Hexen - and wow, have we come far since then! We now see a very cinematic version of the FPS epic series, with cinematic style intro sequences reminiscent of Alien and other great sci-fi series. You're in essence a space marine, part of the Rhino group. Your team is shot down from the sky while landing on a hostile planet, taking out the Strogg. From that point forward, all you need to know is that you have to blow up pretty much everything that moves. I'm sure, with the never-ending sequence of sequels that come out, that people will compare this to old versions of Doom and Quake. They'll also compare it to Halo. Really, unless you want to play with old-system games for years on end, you have to find other things to play. I love Halo and Halo 2. But eventually I want to play new games, if only to try out new maps. Quake has a whole different look-and-feel than Halo does. It's a different universe, a dark, bloody one full of industrial grunge. It's more \"gritty\". And, to be honest, as much as I love Halo, I really appreciated the marines in Quake 4. They appeared to actually work as a team. My medic and techie hung out near me, healing me and giving me support. In Halo it seemed like your teammates were the traditional \"red uniformed security dudes\" from Star Trek - only around to act as cannon fodder during the current episode. In Quake 4, they were much more long lasting, if you played things well. Is this a killer app? Probably not. The graphics are rather impressive on the HD TV - but for example the sky is static. Pretty, but static. The textures down in the mines are detailed, bloody, grungy and very dark - but it gets repetitive. The gameplay is simply blasting, blasting more, blasting more and some dodging. The sound is a stream of bullet blasts. But that being said, that is all the Quake series has ever intended to be. It's a fun way to blow off steam. You have a hard day at work or school, and you come home to blast away enemies for a few hours. It's very stress-relieving. You feel like you make some progress, it's easy to save and pick up the story later on. No complex puzzles, no intricate stealth sequences. It's all about blasting away with great accuracy. If you're a FPS shooter fan, it would seem silly to sit stationary and hold your breath until you turn blue, or until Halo 3 finally emerges. Buy Quake 3, have fun blasting away at dark-and-gloomy enemies, and tune your skills. Other games will be coming out eventually for you to get that eye candy you crave.</td><td>Reasonably Good FPS for Mindless Fun Shooting</td><td>1132963200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>55785</td><td>5.0</td><td>31</td><td>false</td><td>11 26, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00020LZBG</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Ratchet and Clank series is one of the best all around gaming fun on the market. The games are long but interesting, you can replay them countless times, and now it's online too! First, the game is fun for kids and adults. There's a fair amount of humor that will go right over kids' heads, that adults will laugh their heads off of. There are all sorts of references to Aliens, Halo, and other pop culture events. There are also many references to the previous two Ratchet and Clank games, so I highly recommend you get those and play through them. The graphics are really great in a cartooney way. The characters seem quite lifelike - far more than in some pseudo-photorealistic games I've played recently. It's a testament to the talent of the animators of this game. You really do come to be quite fond of the various characters involved. The weapons are simply BRILLIANT and now each one has four levels of upgrade, which makes them change in appearance and improve in functionality. You have lava guns, electric arcing guns, mini-turrets, and my favorites, the little doomie robots. Actually, each weapon is my favorite in certain situations. That's the brilliance here - every weapon can be really a lot of fun. The levels are all plotted out with their own look, feel, music, indigenous monsters, you name it. It is truly amazing how much this affects game enjoyability. Other games I've played recently had music that was lovely, but just didn't fit the mood of the level. It really makes a huge difference to have that done well. Because you can go back to levels and gain more bolts, look for secret bonusses, find the titanium bolts, use your magnetic shoes, etc. etc., there is always room for more fun. This isn't a game that you play through once and put on a shelf. It's just as much time the second or twentieth time through the game, blasting away with your zappy electric gun or setting loose hordes of doomies. And let's not forget the plot, which is full of laugh out loud comments and great, sly comments. This game just has everything you could want. But there's more! The brilliant addition with Up Your Arsenal is the online gameplay. If you become a super player, not only can you kick through the game with ease, but you can take your gameplay online and find out just how good you really are! All of the great weapons and graphics are there for your enjoyment!

The game basically has you controlling a variety of mechanical robots with armor and weapons on a planetary assault mission. You land and start fighting off infantry, tanks, other mechs, and more. There are a bunch of single player missions that you go through on your quest to rid the planet of the enemy. The graphics are quite nice, with rolling fields, rocky mountains, bases full of bridges and vehicles. You can blow up boats, take out bridges, demolish large buildings. You can stomp on infantry and shoot down helicopters. It's very destructive, but all in the name of saving the planet. The mech takes a little getting used to, because of the combinations of flying, twisting torso, movement, and weapon selections you have. But really, for any gamer that's played games for more than a year, this shouldn't be a problem. The controls are rather intuitive and we were up and running with the mech in no time flat. Your ability to pretty much go anywhere and demolish anything means that you can take a number of different approaches to any problem. Add in the fact that you can often choose from a variety of mechs to take on the mission, each with its own configuration, and you can really get involved. Still, the missions are single player and your multiplayer gameplay on your own system is two player only. The single player missions can probably be won in a weekend if you go for the easy settings. But all of these things are merely TRAINING for the true on line experience, with XBox Live!! No AI is ever going to match the true cunning of a human (at least not any time soon) and when you play on XBox Live, you get to play against entire teams of mechs! You can play Capture the Flag, deathmatch, team deathmatch, and MANY other types of games. It is amazingly fun! And you really do need that single player or two-player local mode to practice in, so you can hold your own against the Mech players from around the world. Highly, highly recommended if you have XBox Live. It's a blast! If you don't have XBox live yet, it's a great game to play for a while, if you keep increasing the difficulty level to keep you challenged.</td><td>Great graphics, but it's best LIVE</td><td>1038268800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>39200</td><td>5.0</td><td>108</td><td>false</td><td>11 26, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006JZQZ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>This latest Tom Clancy game has amazing graphics and some incredibly detailed body movements. It takes the spy game genre to an entirely new level! I'm a big spy-game fan in general, and we have all 3 major platforms, so I went into Splinter Cell curious about all the hype. It's gotten incredible ratings from several magazines. I have to say, after having played it, those ratings were well deserved. First, the graphics. The amount of work that went into graphics on this game is just phenomonal. Your character goes through smoke and fire, through darkness and bright neon light, under shaded lattices, through light coming through venetian blinds, through hazy curtains, through punch-hole metalwork. It is just STUNNING. You really begin to believe that this is a movie and you're controlling the outcome. The other senses aren't neglected. Sound is KEY and you are constantly aware of how much noise you're making while you're sneaking around. The speed at which you move, your crouching, your stance, all affect how well people notice you. Unlike other games which blast you with rock music, in this one you're so attuned that you hear the little movements of your own feet as you creep, or the movements of guards walking down the hallway. The animation on the character is fantastic. Press up against a wall. Climb a fence and roll over the top. Slide down a wire. Go hand-over-hand across a pipe, and pull up your feet to get more traction. Slide down a ladder, jump up a wall and do a split to stay there, unseen. The way the character moves is just amazing. Some serious work was put into this effort, and it pays off. The gameplay missions are logical and draw you along into the story. It's not exactly a ring-through-the-nose drag like other games. You are given objectives - \"Get object X which is in building Y\" but you aren't handed a map to follow. Instead, you're put into real-world situations and have to figure out for yourself the best way to accomplish that goal. You could try a frontal assault, you could try the sneaky back way. It's up to you, and your success depends on your ability to think through a situation and then implement your path. The game even encourages you not to be violent. It points out that your aim is stealth, and that you should try to stay unseen and sneak by whenever possible. In most missions you can get through without killing anyone, if you use your head.

The graphics are gorgeous, the main character (female!) has personality, and it's a good combo of shooting, stealth and puzzle solving. We've been of course testing all of the release titles, but we keep coming back to Perfect Dark Zero just for sheer fun of gameplay. First, the basic mission tree. You are Joanna Dark, daughter of a bounty hunter who follows in her father's footsteps. You're athletic, nimble, smart, and maybe a bit fool-hardy. The game is set in the future (Joanna was born in the year 2000) and you get an interesting mix of locales to explore as you take on your assignments. The graphics in this game are simply GORGEOUS, as you might expect from the XBox 360. I highly recommend you play this on a HD TV - I've done screenshots comparing HD to low-def and the difference is rather impressive. The water ripples, the light plays off the rippling water, the rippling water reflects on the textured brick wall, you name it. You get red and blue lights shining down from the ceiling and the lights color their surroundings and even combine where they cross. There are of course some amusing issues - this still isn't photo-realism of course. There are times that a red laser beam has slight \"ripples\" in it, for example. Still, the quality is far better than anything else on the market. I suppose you could complain that Joanna goes running around in high-heeled boots and low-cut pants, but heck, I was impressed that her chest size was reasonably normal. Compared to most other video games out there, with their mostly-naked women with inflato-boobs, Joanna is quite demure! The sound is aiming for a James Bond feel here. I think that is pretty clear from the intro credits. You get a boppy rock soundtrack through much of the game. The dialogue is reasonably well done, and you can't really say much about how gunshots sound. They sound like gunshots. Gameplay is a mix between Splinter Cell and a FPS. There are times that being stealthy and quiet really pay off. There are other times that just running fast and blasting away will work. There are cool lockpick puzzles, too. I do get frustrated that you can't \"jump\" though. I'll see a nice, inviting open window at less than waist high, and I have to walk right by. I have mixed feelings about co-op mode. On one hand it's fun to have two females working side by side and taking out the enemy. On the other hand, if one person decides to quit, it shuts down the whole mission. I really like it on other games where a person can pop in and out as necessary. This especially is helpful if a less experienced gamer is stuck and needs help just for a short while. There's also deathmatch style gaming available, both on local gameplay and XBox Live. This lets you sneak around and head-shot your enemies with great glee. We've played this for many hours and haven't noticed any problems with lag or crashing. There are certain moves that don't happen instantly - for example, when you shoot from cover, you have to wait for Joanna to \"rise from a crouch\" before she fires. This is quite realistic. The game also has cinematic sequences when things go into a Matrix-like slo-mo which seems to be in many current movies. If you play this game on easy mode, you can probably zip through all the missions in a single very long gaming session (say 14-16 hours). The harder levels of difficulty are of course more challenging. Really, though, all single-player gameplay is is just a training mode to help you prepare for live gameplay. Once you've gotten your skills sharpened on the computer players, prepare to take on the real challenge, with real live opponents!

These controllers are GREAT for keeping your gaming area free of clutter. To start with, the controller is much smaller than the standard XBox controller was.  For control items, you start with the standard blue X, yellow Y, red B and green A buttons. There are two thumbsticks, one on the upper left and one in the center right. There is also a directional (d-pad) in the lower left. Next, you have a pair of shoulder buttons at the \"top\" of the unit, up above the other buttons. You also have a pair of triggers below those shoulder buttons. Finally, you have a center X button that can be used to turn the console on and off, plus a \"start\" and \"back\" tiny white buttons on either side of it. The unit has a rechargeable battery unit inside it, the size of two AA batteries. You have to buy a recharger set SEPARATELY that lets you charge up while you play. In essence you plug the charger into the back of the controller - and the other end into the USB port in the front of the XBox 360 unit. So you play with the controller \"wired\" as it charges up. When it's fully charged again, you just pop off the wire and keep playing. The range of the wireless unit is 30', which is probably much further than anybody is really going to even try playing a game at. The wireless is much easier on your hand - no cable holding you down - plus it's a great help in keeping your gaming area organized. You can easily pass the controller from person to person, and visitors can come and go without tripping over wires. The documentation says you can get 40 hours of gameplay between charges, but if you have features such as vibration on, that sucks the time down to maybe 8-10 hours. It's up to you of course - I personally like having vibration on because it is often important for gameplay to get those warning signals. Still, even if I have to plug the cables in every 10 hours or so to give it a juice boost, I still love wireless!! Highly recommended.</td><td>A must-have for XBox 360 Gamers</td><td>1132876800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>70989</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000A0EFJC</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>This game is clearly associated with the 2005 movie. How can we tell? The full name of the game is Peter Jackson's King Kong - The Official Game of the Movie. Subtle! The game was made with complete cooperation of Peter Jackson - he let the gaming team have access to the CGI and sets from the movie, and the game was made at the exact same time. The game plays very much like being in a movie, with smooth slides between cinematic scenes and action sections. That being said, the game of course is FAR more action-oriented than any movie would be. In a movie you might fight off a group of creatures for a short period of time. In the game, of course, the hordes come in numerous, almost endless, waves. This is more than just a beast-slaying game, though. There's a bit of thought involved. For example, if a gigantic dinosaur comes running at you, you don't have to try to slay it in straight-out combat. You can instead kill another random creature that is nearby, and the dinosaur will decide to go munch on it. There are a few levels that you can play as Kong, but really for most of the game you are playing as a normal human in a band of friends. The various friends around you can either be helpful or REALLY annoying, depending on their mood. There are many times that I was tempted to snipe at my \"friends\" instead of the Giant Centipede or whatever the monster of the moment was. The graphics are of course awesome. From the ocean waves to the murky dark caves, from the detail on the faces to the detail on the monsters' teeth, you get immersed in a high quality version of the movie. Again, this is to be expected, as the game designers got direct feeds of the movie graphic files. The sound is also well done, with the sounds and feel of the movie. You get an immersive experience, drawing around you what the movie is all about. Danger, gloom, crashing waves and thunderous primal screams. I have to admit that I found some of the puzzles a little tedious. Walking around and around a post to open a door was silly enough the first time, but for me to have to do it repeatedly was a bit much. Also, there were a few times that monsters seemed to get \"stuck\" in an area and I had to in essence go and prod them a few times for them to come out and properly attack me. I suppose not all monsters are highly intelligent :) The game is definitely one that targets adrenaline-rush types. The sounds are loud and pounding - from bellows to cries of panic to screeches. The video is always jumping between dark caves to dark stairs to fiery bushes and things swooping down at you. You're kept off balance and rarely get a moment to breathe. I did like how the game is set up like a movie. There aren't on screen health bars, ammo counters or anything else. You hit a button to hear a verbal check of your ammo. You talk to your friends to find out how they are. When you get hurt, your screen starts to go red and fuzzy, and you even hear \"angels sing\". If I'm going to have any complaint about this game, it's really a personal one - I like games with a balance between hyped-up tension and more calm puzzle/investigating. There was really no break here, it was just non-stop thundering noise and attacking monsters. I'm sure most people thrive on that :) Well recommended for those seeking a high action fix!</td><td>Great Game for the Action Game Lover</td><td>1132876800</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>73895</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000B6MLTQ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The basic, default controller that comes with the XBox 360 core unit is the wired controller. This controller is much smaller than the standard XBox controller was. For control items, you start with the standard blue X, yellow Y, red B and green A buttons. There are two thumbsticks, one on the upper left and one in the center right. There is also a directional (d-pad) in the lower left. Next, you have a pair of shoulder buttons at the \"top\" of the unit, up above the other buttons. You also have a pair of triggers below those shoulder buttons. Finally, you have a center X button that can be used to turn the console on and off, plus a \"start\" and \"back\" tiny white buttons on either side of it. The unit is relatively light, compared to the other console systems. The wire is grey and is 9' long, so that gives you a reasonable distance to sit from the console unit. Still, wireless of course is FAR superior because you can sit at any angle, and have people come and go without tripping on wires. Certainly this is a good enough item to get you started, and I definitely suggest you have at least one of these on hand for when your batteries die on the wireless unit.</td><td>Must Have One for your XBox 360</td><td>1132876800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>73705</td><td>5.0</td><td>65</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000B6ML28</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>If you're a racing fan, this is a must-have game for your XBox 360. If you're just looking to see how good the graphics are on the XBox 360, at lesat rent this game. It's quite impressive!!  You choose from a number of real cars. There are Ferraris, Jaguars, Aston Martins, Lamborghinis, McLarens and much more. The cars look AMAZINGLY good with full detail, and you can choose the color as well. You race your car through a number of circuits around some quite recognizeable towns. You end up in London, Las Vegas, New York City, Tokyo and Nurburgring. Each location is full of detail. When you drive down the river Thames in London you pass Big Ben. Vegas has gorgeous hotels that I remember from my visits there. Doing fun stunts earns you Kudos points, so not only are you aiming to win your races to earn cash, but you also want to rack up Kudos points. That makes even the easier races fun, as you do spins, slides and much more. The world you're in is quite interactive. The people watching the race take flash pictures as you drive past - but if you crash into a fence near them, they all cringe. There are clouds floating by overhead. Mostly, though, there are other racers on the track trying to get by you and steal the lead. We found the controls to be very intuitive, and the cars handled quite nicely. Note that this is a GAME racing system - i.e. it's not pure realistic. If you smash into a wall at 100mph, your car does not explode into a thousand shards of metal. You simply spin off gently and keep going. That being said, most gamers really don't want a \"realistic\" racing game. They want a fun one, and this game delivers across the board. I have to admit that for me, half the fun in this game is the gorgeous landscapes. In Vegas, you drive past the Excalibur and Treasure Island, and the details are picture-perfect. New York, New York is by the track in quite amazing clarity. I also love the sound in this game - because the soundtrack options are simply awesome. You can choose from a number of soundtracks, from classical to alternative to J-Pop and more. You can even stream in music from your iPod or other MP3 player! I suppose if you hate racing games, you probably will find this game to be boring. You're just racing cars around in circles with pretty scenery and great sound. But you'd have to be in the minority to not enjoy this game. The cars are amazing. The graphics are amazing. The sound is amazing. Because of the multiplayer options, including up to 8 simultanous live players online, you could play this game for eternity and still find people to challenge you. If you want even MORE of a challenge, you can even create your own custom route through their maps! You can design your very own custom lap system and challenge others to play on it. Talk about variety!

First, the packaging. All of the XBox components we've bought have come in a thick plasic unit, to keep it safe from thieves I imagine. The faceplate plastic outerwear tells you to cut across the very top with scizzors, to help you open it without damaging the faceplate. However, at the very bottom is the instructions, so you have to dig them out! To begin installation, you have to of course pry off the starting faceplate. This isn't exactly an easy task. At the very bottom of the faceplate (beneath the USB area) is a slot that you have to pull out on. Unless you have a very strong fingernail, find a screwdriver and pull out gently. That should get the faceplate to pull off straight towards you. You'll be able to see that there are 4 tabs on the upper face and 3 on the lower face that hold the faceplate on. The tabs don't have \"edges\" like I've seen on most computer faceplates, they are more rounded. Hopefully this will help them not wear out as quickly, but I'm not sure personally that I would want to continuously add and remove faceplates from this system. The tabs don't look like they would last up to multiple pulls. Simply press the new faceplate on, and you're all set. I like the blue one shown, but they also have a wood-themed one, a black flame unit and a silver unit. Is it really necessary to have a new faceplate for your XBox 360? Of course not. But it does add a bit of personalization to your unit, and the price is pretty reasonable!</td><td>Fun Customization for a Reasonable Price</td><td>1132876800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>73724</td><td>5.0</td><td>148</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000B6MLS2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>If you have a wireless controller for your XBox 360, then you MUST get a play and charge unit. This unit lets you recharge your wireless controller - and you can even play while you do it! In essence, this unit is both a USB power supply for your wireless controller as well as a fully functional cable to connect your wireless controller to your XBox. This means that any time you need your wireless controller to be wired - for example because your batteries ran out - you simply use this cable to plug it into the XBox's USB port and it now has power. It even charges while you play. On the other hand, let's say you want to charge up the wireless controller and you do NOT want to play. You simply plug it into any USB port in your house, and the USB port sends power to charge it up! Yes, this can be your XBox, if you're the type to leave it on. Maybe you're watching a movie or listening to music with it. It doesn't HAVE to be your XBox, though. You can plug it into your computer. Heck, when I got my iPod it came with a power box that plugs into an outlet, that has a USB hole in it. That's how I charge up my iPod. It works just as well for this charging use. So I find this to be a perfect solution. If your wireless controller is low on batteries and you want to keep playing, then keep playing! You plug in the cable and are set, and the controller recharges while you play. If your wireless controller is low on batteries and you do NOT want to keep playing, then you plug the play-and-charge cable into any USB port for an ON SYSTEM and it powers up. I put the emphasis on the \"on system\" because a few people complain that the XBox has to be on in order for the wireless controller to charge. Simply put, an OFF system can't charge. That's a fact of electronics. Really, most homes should have some USB device turned on pretty much 24 hours a day - whether it's your XBox, your computer, or the plug-in-the-wall iPod type power unit. It's about as basic a charger as you could want to have, and I find it perfect!</td><td>A Must-Have for Every XBox Owner</td><td>1132876800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>51483</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000D12XI</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Max Payne is a film noir mature gaming title that involves gunfights and long, drawn out, introspective speeches full of cliches and pouring rain under a dark, starless sky. There are probably few shooter players left who have not heard of the Max Payne game. Its original graphics and storyline made it a must-play for many. Max Payne 2 is set in New York City, and the hero has had a rough life. Now he runs into a woman he thought was dead and sets out on a tale of betrayal and shooting. Lots of shooting. This isn't a game for puzzle solvers or for those who want to explore the intricate detail of a quest's lore. It's about blasting your way through problems and finding the best way to get rid of those enemies. There are great graphics, great sounds, great bullet-time effects. But the thing that stands out in most peoples' minds is the cliche-ridden dialogue that gives the game its atmosphere. You can't escape it. It's like a thick fog in London, swirling all around you. It permeates the game and gives it depth. So watch all of those classic Philip Marlowe movies, and then get set for Max Payne, where you control the story.</td><td>Perfect Film Noir Gameplay</td><td>1069718400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>51685</td><td>4.0</td><td>23</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000E2OBD</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Final Fantasy XI Online is finally out, and millions of Final Fantasy fans are enjoying the fun world of chocobos and airships in an online MMORPG. The graphics and sounds are lush, and the cut scenes and quests make you really feel like this is an adventure game in addition to a MMORPG. There are all the familiar elements - from chocobos, airships, and familiar faces - plus enough new things to keep it interesting. Like all other MMORPGs, this is about creating a character, developing him or her by gaining levels and experience, killing monsters, going on quests, and developing group friendships. It has to be said that every MMORPG appeals to a different type of gamer. FFXI will appeal to gamers who are patient and who are in it for the long haul with their friends. Levelling up is slow. The learning curve is difficult, and it can take you a LONG time before you do things that are considered \"fun\" like riding chocobos or airships. You'll have to put in long hours before you can get your character a sub-job or an advanced class. And you'll need friends to help you achieve those goals. Also on the annoying side, you can't choose what world you start on. Only after you put in time and effort can you \"buy\" the ability for a friend to start on the same world as you did. So while we bought 2 copies of the game at the same time so we could play together, the game prevented us from doing so. So really the game is about one person going on first, and creating a character to get those \"World Passes\". Then he starts inviting on friends and slowly the entire group of friends can join a server. Then together they can start the long quest to develop their characters. This might be fine for people who don't work and have hours and hours to do nothing but sit in front of a computer screen, but for most of us, this is a detriment. If you have 2 hours to play in a given evening and want to go questing, that's fun. But if the quest involves finding an item and the game only has that item spawn once every 3 hours, now you've wasted 2 hours trekking around an empty desert and have achieved nothing. That is NOT fun. Hopefully the FFXI designers will get a better balance of the game so that those with 8+ hours a day to blow on game-playing will enjoy the slow pace, but so that those who want something enjoyable to play that doesn't invade their entire life can have fun as well. A game doens't have to be easy to be enjoyable - it just has to give results when you put in the effort.</td><td>Good MMORPG for those with spare hours</td><td>1069718400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>45231</td><td>5.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000093NQM</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>While some first person shooters go for realism, XIII brings you into a comic book world of slow motion falls and fun camera angles, all in cel shaded glory!

And, of course, Who You Can Trust. The plot is long and complicated and great fun to work through. But it's the graphics that really shine. This is all cel shaded, so you really feel like you're in a comic book story. They have cut scenes to add to that feeling. If someone's standing up on a cliff and you shoot them down, little \"AAaaaaggghhh\"s trail after them! There are all sorts of effects like that that are very fun to watch. The interface is very easy to use. Symbols pop up to show you when you can perform actions. There's the usual medkits, weapons and ammo. They do a GREAT job with this. If an enemy's gun runs out, they have to reload. If you take too long to get to them and they fire a lot of bullets, their ammo will be gone when you pick up the gun! There's great multiplayer here too, with a variety of maps and gameplay options. So even when you finish the game, there will be much more fun to be had. I was worried that with all the hype surrounding this game that it wouldn't deliver. And indeed, some people at the game shop I buy from claimed that they were disappointed.

In the first 'training' mission, you're driving a car through city streets. The lights reflect off of the curves of the car, you can see inside to all of his controls and movements, the dents show up realistically, the back up lights glow softly, and if you bash it a bit, the trunk comes loose. The city around you has cobblestone streets, water rippling, streetlights that come down when you hit them. The attention to detail is just amazing! As you then move on through the various levels, you see this same level of detail everywhere. From the Austrian castle and other alpine scenes, to the city scenes, watery scenes and more, each really shines. The plot is very engaging and typically Bond. But in an attempt to show that this isn't about violence - he's a SPY after all, not a Rambo - you get bonus points for being stealthy instead of blasting in with guns, and for stunning or capturing enemies instead of killing them. In fact, just about every area can be 'accomplished' in many ways. Bluster your way into an objective by a full frontal assault ... or sneak in the side way for extra points. Since you're also rewarded for your time and health, often the sneaky, non-violent way is the best. You've got a huge array of equipment, weapons, armor and vehicles, and all work just the way you'd expect them to.

It's a fully immersive role playing game where you take on the personae of an elf, dwarf, barbarian, human, ogre, troll or many other types of characters. You can then choose what type of profession you want, from magician, paladin, ranger, warrior, and more. You can be another person, and live in another world. Isn't this something we've all dreamed of from childhood? You can customize your gender, your face, hair style, hair color and eyes too, although the choices are few and the click-cycling gets annoying. A few more brief choices and you're in your starting town, ready to explore, learn, and kill some wildlife. The graphics are rather nice, with each creature type having its own body shape and size. Look at a tall ogre standing next to a little halfling and the two really are quite different! Head out to attack small spiders and larger polar bears, or do some fishing and tailoring if that's more your speed. You can concentrate on combat, or magic, or making things, or just hanging out and talking. The world has it all. The Planes of Power CD is good for those just starting, because it has everything you need to get going. It's also a nice expansion for experienced users, because it lets the higher leveled characters enter new, interesting worlds. The planes also let you easily move between towns, something that was a bit difficult before. EverQuest, being an online RPG, requires a monthly fee to keep playing.  This gets you your own server with special weapons, armor, events and dynamic maps. With over 50 servers to choose from for regular gameplay, there are thousands of people on line at all times to interact with and work on quests with. EverQuest has been played for so long by such a huge volume of gamers that just about every part of the system has been finely tuned. The animations for spells are gorgeous, as is the clothing for characters. You can customize just about any key you want, customize the music playing in the background, customize the background of the various status boxes, move them around the screen, fade them out when they're not in use. It's really a treat to play this if you've only played some of the older RPGs. If you're a RPG fan, EverQuest is definitely a game to give a try to, either by buying the CD and doing the free-month, or playing it at a friend's house. Most regular games you buy on CD give you less than a month's gameplay anyway, and if you DO enjoy the game a lot, for only another  each month you get another full month's enjoyment.

Instead of just racing to the end of a course, you have to do so with style. Ride on two wheels, do spins, and avoid hitting other cars and objects for more points. The more points you get, the more special features and courses you unlock. The courses and towns are done extremely well.

While I've been disappointed with many recent ones, I was really pleased by Obi Wan. The light saber duels are really the shining part of the game. The fluidity and grace with which he moves really embodies the Jedi Knight's years of training. Add in a few force moves, and you really do feel like you can take on seemingly overwhelming enemies and come out victorious. Playing in multiplayer against a talented friend can challenge you for months. The game was pushed out for the release of the XBox, so there are some down sides. The graphics don't really shine, because the system was still being explored for its capabilities. The levels are very short. And there are a few bugs in the game that are mildly annoying.

It is expected to contain high quality graphics and sound, and unfortunately it has neither. From the sort of cheesy leaves falling at the beginning to the low-budget music that plays behind the action, the game looks as if it was a straight port from the base Playstation. And indeed, rumor has it that this is the case. The storyline is intriguing. You are one of two characters - Sharline or Darius - giving a nice male-female balance to the game. You explore the polygon world as in most RPGs, looking for enemies to kill and gathering up mushrooms and special items. The terrain itself is on the restrictive side, limiting where you can go and what you can see.  Often vital items cannot be seen, and monsters will appear within rocks. Combat is not very exciting, with slow paced action, really stupid computer moves and limited fighting options. Taking a nod from the Diablo 2 gem system, you can find Palmira gems and add them to your weapons and armor. Add to that horrendous mouth-matching-words problems (and times the spoken message doesn't match the written one on the screen), cheezy videos, an awful font choice for displaying messages, I'd say to set this one aside and give Final Fantasy IX a try.

A typical beginning, and unfortunately the first-person shooter graphics are also of Playstation-One quality, hardly taking advantage of the speed and power of the PS2. The cut scenes are uninspiring, with mouths moving much longer than it takes to get through the text. The monsters, like tadpoles and wasps, will drop water gems and feather gems for you to collect. The graphics are reasonable, but not up to some of the other PS2 game levels. Really, though, what you seek are the rings. There are tons of rings in the game, and by equipping combinations of them you can create yourself a great number of spells or powers. Gameplay in this sense is quite intriguing - you can easily get caught up in gathering rings, figuring out which items work best for your style of gameplay, and fight to the end. Combat is reasonably interesting. In general, though, I play RPG and action games not just to shoot hordes of monsters, but to really get involved with the characters. I just can't care about Cain - he has no personality, and it often seems like just a dungeon crawl (i.e. killing anything in your path) instead of a real game. I think they might have rushed this one to get out in time for the PS2 release, and hope that their next release will spend more time in development.</td><td>First-person fantasy shooter doesn't live up to PS2 promise</td><td>975024000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>20690</td><td>5.0</td><td>7</td><td>false</td><td>11 24, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000522AC</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>This game is GREAT fun if you're any sort of race-game enthusiast.

There are a variety of ways to play - time trials, tournament play, challenges, arcade style, or 'realistic'. You can choose automatic or manual shifting, and there is a wide variety of bikes available from Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha and other lesser known brands. The graphics are simply stunning. You easily start to feel that you really are on a motorcycle, watching the suspension work and the rear wheel kick out. The replays are gorgeous to watch, and almost feel like a real motorcycle race. I'm tempted to show a replay to a friend casually and see how long it takes them to realize it's a game. The racers you compete with are all named racers from the real world, and as you complete bonus challenges you get to see fun photos of them playing the game. They obviously put a lot of work into this, between the accurate gameplay and great graphics. On the downside, there are only five tracks, and the racers aren't using real racing techniques - they ride single file most of the time, not passing each other or riding in groups like they would in a real race.

Gameplay brings back the addictive qualities of pong and other such games - try to put spin and lob on the ball to sneak past your opponents. You can play with up to four players, using the computer as substitutes for humans if you wish. There are different court types to add complexity to gameplay. There are also a series of fun games where you have to get the most rings, or use special items, or even play on a moving base. There are also competitions where you work your way progressively through your opponents until you emerge the victor.

However, the inclusion of a highly variable difficulty system can curb this issue. Silent Hunter 5 places the player in command of a German U-Boat during World War 2. Their missions range from disrupting enemy trade convoys to destroying enemy warships. However, one of the main concepts of the game is the idea that there is a \"natural\" world - friendly and enemy ships go along their business for the player to help or hinder as they see fit. Therefore, while the missions provide a general objective for the player, in actuality it's more like a sandbox game (but set in the ocean). The game is controlled with a combination of map waypoints (to move the submarine), depth and speed settings, and periscope-based torpedo targeting. It's a fairly simple system once you get used to it, though on higher difficulty levels the presence of things like limited oxygen or batteries will make it more complex tactically. The game is seen mostly from the inside of the U-Boat the player captains. Moving through its belly, looking through a periscope, and climbing onto the deck all give a sense of enclosure, even claustrophobia, that actual submarine crews would have felt. However, the tight quarters also allow for intuitive use of different tools; you quickly locate where things like the periscope and map table are, and the whole submarine feels like an extension of the HUD. One of the first things that's noticeable in the game is the attention to detail in depicting the environment. Not only are the ships fully rendered, even to the point of crew running around on the decks, but the game itself takes place in the cramped confines of the U-Boat. This sense of immersion is highly involved in making the game more of a \"simulation\" than a game. The technical details present help establish this: it's possible to measure out routes with a compass (as in, a mapping compass, not a north-pointing compass) to determine things like interception routes and so on. This isn't necessary for more casual players, but on harder difficulties it's a necessity. This is a neat aspect of the game: it's \"unrealistic\" on lower levels in a way that can be dealt with by players unfamiliar with submarine warfare. However, instead of being \"dumbed down\" like a lot of games, it just makes it so all the realistic parts are a higher difficulty level. There were a few parts that were a bit buggy and frustrating. One DLC measure taken by the game is making your save games online rather than local. If you want to load a savegame, you have to be on the internet connected to their server. The game also crashed fairly often, and the long load times (due to the huge areas loaded) didn't help this. An in-game issue I had was that when you zoomed in and out on the map the coastline would shift slightly. This isn't a problem for plotting short-term trips, but the first campaign has you navigating past Denmark to reach the North Atlantic, and doing so always ends up getting me caught on a bit of coastline while going at high speed (which naturally sinks the ship). The navigation, essentially, works well on the open ocean, but isn't great for navigating tight areas. Overall, SH5 is an intimidating, but interesting, game. It's not exactly a good game for casual players, but people interested in military history or more serious gaming fare might consider giving it a go. Its outside problems like the savegame issues and crashing are more distracting, however. 7/10.</td><td>a treat for dedicated historians and submarine fans</td><td>1290470400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>201376</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>11 23, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B002EE5ROO</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>\"Dead Rising 2\" offers more zombie-killing goodness, and is easily picked up by anyone who's played the first game. The game is largely improved, but these improvements have found strange ways of affecting the game as a whole. Like it's predecessor, \"Dead Rising 2\" has a fairly simple premise: You play as an average character trapped in a mall for 72 hours. Your mission is to fight zombies, rescue survivors, and uncover the plot behind the outbreak. In DR1, you were playing as photographer Frank West. In DR2, the player takes the role of Chuck Greene, a motocross superstar trying to pay for his daughter's anti-Zombie medication. The location is changed from a large shopping mall to \"Fortune City\", a Vegas-like strip full of casinos, movie theaters, and restaurants, but the basic gameplay is the same: use whatever you can to defeat zombies and save your fellow humans. One of the main differences between DR1 and DR2 is the character's \"special ability\". In DR1, you played as a photographer, so the player could take pictures to earn experience points. In DR2, you play as a character with a mechanical background, so your special ability is to combine things to form new weapons. Dead Rising had a lot of improvised weapons (basically anything you found in the mall could be picked up and used as a weapon, from park benches to trash cans to handfuls of jewelry), but in DR2 these items can be combined. Some of them are simple (baseball bat + nails = baseball bat with nails in it), some of them are peculiar (jewelry + leaf blower = shotgun-like gem launcher), and some of them are outright insane (it's possible to make a fully-functional lightsaber). Another change from Dead Rising 1 is that the game feels a lot easier overall. The zombies present more of an obstacle, but survivors are much smarter (compared to DR1's survivors, who had to be led around every step of the way) and solving the main plot is pretty hard to mess up. One feature of the Dead Rising games is the fact that you can restart the game with your earned experience. In DR1 this was necessary because it was difficult to beat the game on your first try, because of how much time it took to rescue survivors. In DR2, it's pretty easy to beat it on the first or second try, which sort of cut down on replay value. Dead Rising 2 is full of little changes that make the game a lot more convenient - better AI, easier missions, the radio is less annoying, and so on. The funny thing about this is that while these are all good changes, they almost make the game \"too\" easy. It's not a bad thing, just a notable change. The graphics are pretty good. There's a wide variety of environments, from shopping areas to different theme casinos, and basically it feels like a place where people would really work and shop (for the most part). This helps drive home the nature of the zombie apocalypse scenario. In competing zombie franchise \"Left 4 Dead\", many of the environments seemed deliberately made, rather than depicting \"actual locations\". Dead Rising 2 does a better job at seeming like a real place overrun by zombies. Overall, Dead Rising 2 was a lot of fun to go through. Veterans of the first game may find a lot of stuff familiar (things like which foods restore the most health and so on), but the new combination system will give even the most invested DR1 players something new to experiment with. Those new to the series will be able to spend a few hours trying out different weapons, items, and foods to see what works best for them, as well as exploring the whole of Fortune City. Dead Rising 2 is a game with a lot of meat to it, and is both fun and content-rich.

It tries to keep some of the themes intact, and does a pretty good job about the setting and designs, but also seems divorced as a game. As an individual game, it does a fairly decent job of being entertaining. Front Mission Evolved is a mech combat game combining action-heavy gameplay with some customization features. Players pilot \"wanzers\" (short for \"wanderpanzer\", meaning \"walking tank), which are similar  to any number of human-shaped giant robots. These mechs can be equipped with different weapons, armor types, backpacks, and so on. Like in the older games, there is a balance of weight and power versus the amount of weapons and ammo carried. However, the core gameplay itself is much different than previous Front Mission games. While these were strategy role-playing games, Front Mission Evolved prefers to let the player pilot a mech themselves. Each Wanzer has four weapon slots: The right hand is used to hold a gun (usually a machine gun or shotgun), the left hand is used for melee attacks, and the two shoulders are used to hold missile or rocket launchers. The backpack slot is by default used for a jetpack (which allows hovering) but can be replaced with repair gear, extra ammo, jamming equipment, and so on. The game's combat is good, but also sort of boring: you move the reticle over the target, you pull the trigger, you move on. There's not a lot you can do that differs from the basic model. As far as combat goes, the only real things that stand out as being markedly different from other action games is the gliding mechanic and locational damage. The former is a battlefield tactic; by using a jetpack as a sort of roller skate, the wanzer can be much more mobile than they would be by walking. This is an invaluable tactic, since walking out to shoot an enemy also leaves you exposed. Gliding makes it much safer to skate out, fire a missile, and skate back to cover. The latter refers to the fact that wanzers take damage in their arms and legs as well as their body. If a section is damaged enough, it becomes unusable. The player's mech will regenerate body health, but not limb health (which requires finding a repair kit). Enemy mechs are generally not worth crippling, since it's just as easy to hit their torso as it is to hit their limbs. Front Mission is a decent game in terms of graphics, sound, gameplay, and so on. However, its biggest failing is that it doesn't really have anything that sets it apart. It's about the same as Armored Core, with perhaps a bit more customization. There haven't been many mech games recently, so it's sort of filling a niche, but the customization isn't good enough to actually fill mech enthusiasts' needs. It's the kind of game that's worth picking up if you liked Armored Core or Mech Assault, but only in the sense that you can chew through its content and its multiplayer and be done with it. There wasn't anything innately appealing about the game itself.

As such, it's closer to an adventure game than survival-horror, but it still packs a punch. \"Silent Hill: Shattered Memories\" preserves the main story concept from Silent Hill's first game: You are Harry Mason, trapped in the town of Silent Hill looking for your daughter Cheryl. However, while the original was about defeating monsters and solving puzzles, this game  is based on differing story paths based on the player's choices and actions. Some of these choices are more obvious - for example, the game begins with a psychological survey. Others, like where your eyes focus during certain scenes, are more subtly recorded. Like in Silent Hill 2, every action - even out of cutscenes - can potentially alter the course of events; this isn't limited to the development of the plot, but also things like the appearance and behavior of certain characters. The game is divided up into three major game modes: \"cutscene\", \"exploration\", and \"escape\". Cutscenes in this game are for the most part semi-interactive. You can look around, fiddle with things, and so on during cutscenes. In some cases, the Wiimote will be used to agree/disagree by \"nodding\" or \"shaking\" your field of vision. Some factors, like where your eyes look during cutscenes, are not explicitly noted by the game, but are registered nonetheless. The trick is figuring out what the game \"cares\" about and what it doesn't - but the process of discovery is interesting in its own right. Exploration scenes make up the majority of the game. Unlike in previous games, there is no combat, so exploration consists largely of trying to find keys and so on. The only \"encounters\" are ghostly images and messages that the player can discover, which are fairly unsettling, but it lacks the oppressive atmosphere of previous Silent Hill games. Until I realized this, it had a lot more potential for scary stuff, but the only combat-like portions are put into very identifiable sections: the \"escape\" sections. In Escape scenes, Harry has to run from monsters; it's fast-paced and more about evasion than defeating enemies. Usable doors are marked with a teal glow, though they may not be the \"right\" route or the \"best\" route. Some interactive environmental pieces will slow down enemies or can be used to evade them, like lockers (can be hidden in) or windows (can be jumped through). These scenes are fast-paced enough to be disconcerting, but the way they're \"sectioned off\" means that the tension in general is sort of weird. Rather than being something that can happen anytime, these sequences are very distinct and reflect a major gameplay change. This negatively affects the atmosphere of paranoia the game tries to foster. Essentially, the most interesting part of the game is how choices affect gameplay. The actual branching paths may be relatively limited, but you do get a sense of \"the way you choose\" actually determining what happens. It's a game where the player is constantly being judged, even if they don't know what for. If choices are made honestly, the game says something about the player, too. It's not just the usual \"pick dialogue options\" set-up; occasionally, there will be an activity like coloring a house or hearing a story and determining who the \"guilty\" party is. It's a neat attempt to actually explore different methods of interaction. The graphics aren't great, but the animation is smooth and fluid. The environments don't feel as scary as previous Silent Hill games, but this is most likely because the blood and rust theme of previous games is replaced by a snow-and-ice theme. The interface is pretty good, especially since Harry's phone serves as the primary menu system. Overall, Shattered Memories is a good addition to the Silent Hill series while being radically different, gameplay-wise, than the other games. It's not quite as expansive as it could be, but it definitely feels like your choices and actions have consequences. For this reason alone, it's worth trying out.

This version features a more adult Link who rides a horse, swings a sword and saves the day. The title is available for both the GameCube and the Wii, and there are definitely some advantages with the Wii. First, you can see the game in 480p, which is DVD quality. It's not quite high definition, but it's still quite nice! Second, you get widescreen, which means you get much more game to see on the screen. Finally, you get to use the motion sensing controllers on your Wii to swing your sword, go fishing, aim your slingshot, and much more. First, the gameplay. Most gamers will be thrilled to hear that Link is less cartooney in this game. That's not to say it's a mature title - it's still a game without blood. You kill evil enemies who vanish in a puff of smoke. You go on a variety of quests, and it's very much good-against-evil. Rather, with this Link you're not a little 6 year old on a toy sailboat. Your Link is in his late teens, has his own house, owns a horse. He is harassed by three little tykes, but there's a certain young lady whose large eyes catch at Link's heart. In no time at all Link is out in a world which is not all butterflies and daffodils. There are dark things afoot in Hyrle. The land is covered in twilight, and you turn into a wolf to deal with the shadows. Your senses serve you well in this realm. It's not too scary for kids - but it gives the game much more depth for older players. The graphics are rather impressive for a Link game. Remember, the game is still a cartoon, so you're not seeing detailed tanks or the pores in the characters faces. The world you are in is stylized. There is plenty of detail in 480p - or even in regular TV resolution - to show the orange pumpkins, green vines, and fluffy white chickens which make up Hyrule. The water ripples, the dust billows and the fire flickers in the fireplace. How about the sound? The Link games were famous (or notorious) for the silly noises characters make. None talk. I suppose this makes it easy for them to convert the game to every language in the world - they just change the text out and are all set. Also, you can change your name and your horse's name without any speaking issues. The voices might not know how to pronounce \"Shadowfax\". Gameplay is just amazing in its length and depth. There are numerous worlds to traverse and dungeons to delve into. There are the standard collection of mini-games, quests, things to collect, puzzles to solve. You could easily play this for months and not be done. This isn't a game to race through to say \"I solved it\" and move on to something else. It's a world to immerse yourself in, to get to know every hill and dale, to track down those secret locations. I really like how the Wii controllers integrate into the game. It's not like you are using them constantly, getting exhausted with hand movements. Instead, you do a fair portion with the regular joysticks for fine movement. The joysticks are used in a more general way, for sweeping sword attacks or relaxing fishing. You can use small movements if you want - but it's much more fun if you get into the spirit of things and swing away. Just make sure you have that wrist strap properly connected! Downsides? The little \"he he he\" voices can get annoying quickly, especially if you are stuck on a puzzle and they are tormenting you. Sometimes the checkpoints send you back further than you might like. They do a good job of giving you little nudges if you get stuck, helping you figure out your way through the puzzles. In general, I think they struck a great balance between \"tame enough for younger kids\" and \"in depth enough for older players\". There are a lot of teen and adult Zelda fans out there, and they'll be quite pleased with what the game offers. This is definitely one of those must-have for gamers who like adventure games even the slightest!</td><td>Great, Involving Gameplay for All Ages</td><td>1164240000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>38516</td><td>5.0</td><td>16</td><td>false</td><td>11 23, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006IJO5</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Our entire household plays Asheron's Call, and we've been RPGing on the net since the days of MUSHes. We beta tested Ultima Online, the first real graphic MMORPG, and the other MMORPGs as they came along. We were all beta testers for Asheron's Call 2 as well. We were very interested to see how the game would be updated, what they would keep and what would change. We got the full copy as soon as it came out. The graphics are easily the first thing you notice, and they are a HUGE upgrade. Asheron's Call (AC) already had rather impressive graphics with a GEforce 3 - the weather changes, lighting, and outfits and monsters were done quite nicely. But the Asheron Call 2 engine is an amazing step forward. Run through the water and watch the water ripple around your legs. Even better, dive off a cliff and watch your arching descent into the water. The trees leaves wave in the wind, the fountains shimmer and glow. The monsters are all unique with very intricate movements. While in the previous version you chose from three types of human (generally 'European', 'Oriental', and 'Middle Eastern') you now choose from three types of sentient creatures. You can be the medium sized, athletic humans, the big, strong, solid Lugians, or the small, thin, wiery Tumeroks. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. When you customize your character, the detail is amazing, much as in Earth and Beyond. You choose the body height and thickness, the hair color and style, the tattoos and clothing colors, and much more. In each case there are a whole range to choose from, from hair colors to hair styles to facial types. Your character is very much a recognizeable individual. Add in clothing, and you'll be hard pressed to find two alike in the world. Each character has skills they choose to be good at, much like any other role playing game.  If you wish to be good in combat and go out slaughtering the local creatures, you can do that. Learn magic, and either kill enemies directly or help 'buff' your friends so they are better, at least until your spells wear off. But the game also heavily rewards those who enjoy making items, something that was becoming popular on AC. Gather up items with the appropriate raw materials and craft yourself new clothing, a new bow, and much more. This brings up one change that many AC players dislike. In AC, you could make minor items - say fletch wood into arrows, or catch a rabbit and make rabbit pie. I was a personal fan of cooking :) You could then sell the items back to shopkeepers (non-player characters) and earn money that way. In AC2, there ARE no non player characters. So if you make things, you have to find someone else willing to buy them. If you want something, you either have to make it for yourself or track down someone to buy it from. Since most people aren't on 24 hours a day, this can become somewhat tricky and frustrating. Still, the way that most trades were made on AC were either in 'subway' (a dungeon with many entrances and exits) or for more important items, via auctions on web message boards. People would bid for items, bidding in the game currency, and whoever won the auction would arrange to meet the character to do an in-game swap. If anything, AC2 promotes even more of this in-game economy. I enjoyed the human-shopkeep mentality from Ultima Online and thought it gave an outlet to those who were creative but not of a monster-killing mentality. I think that it was great for AC2 to head in this direction, but still think having a few basic shopkeeps around would have been helpful. When playing AC2 sometimes, there were literally so many people in some areas that I couldn't find monsters to kill to get raw materials, and I trudged far and wide trying to find some 'available' monsters. There are all sorts of touches that show how great it is to have a game that's been played VERY heavily for many years. The characters can grab musical instruments and play different songs, and jam together. The commands are the same as in AC but have been tweaked to be even more useable. The changing of the day/night, and shadows, and weather, and seasons,all make you really feel part of an organic world. There are still quests, for those who enjoy questing. There are random monsters for those who enjoy hack-and-slash. There are things to make for those who enjoy creating. And there are the various monarchies and groups for those who enjoy community and want to forge friendships. Those who enjoy the 'richness' of AC's community might forget that it grew over many years, just as the communities in DuneMUSH and the early Ultima Online and at EverQuest have all grown. To expect AC2 to spring to life with that level is a bit unreasonable. Like every RPG, it will coalesce over time. Sure, AC2 has bugs to start with. Every on line game does. And over the weeks and months, those bugs get sorted out and gameplay is tweaked until it shines. I know that many AC players will have invested so many months (if not years) in their characters that it'll be hard for them to give them up. In the boards I've been on, there is certainly a die-hard contingent that swears they'll stay on AC with their friends and characters until the server is shut down. But on the other hand, copies of AC2 are flying off the shelves and people are having to scrounge to get their hands on copies. The new game is AMAZING in many ways. And as the months go on, AC will seem more and more dated with its old style graphics and falling number of players. I suppose I liken it to playing Doom when Unreal Tournament is out. Yes, I used to play Doom for hours and hours and loved the graphics and gameplay. But in 2002, given the ability to play Unreal Tournament with its gameplay and graphics, the Doom CD sits on the shelf. I have fond memories of Doom, and my time spent with it made me a better gamer, better to appreciate what gaming has to offer now.</td><td>An enormous step for MMORPGs, from a long time RPGer</td><td>1038009600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>197849</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>11 22, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B002BSC55M</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>A revamp of the Playstation Portable, the PSP Go is lighter and more ergonomically designed, and trades the UMD drive for a purely downloadable set of games. While in many ways it's an improvement, it's not the best for people who already have a collection of PSP games. The PSP Go is smaller than the \"normal\" PSP, but this is in large part due to the removal of the UMD drive. The screen itself is not much smaller, and the lightness and size of the PSP Go makes up for the loss of the drive. This is compounded by the PSP Go's sliding screen: normally, the directional pad, analog stick, and main buttons are covered by the screen. The screen is slid up when in use, and slid back down over those buttons when not in use. It slides easily into most pockets, unlike its bulkier predecessor. Due to its lack of UMD support (at least without a peripheral device), the PSP Go gets all its games online through the Playstation Network Store. The hard drive can hold up to 16 gigabytes, but the size of the games varies: MGS: Peace Walker, for example, takes up 1/10th of the entire system. The download process takes a while, but is arguably more convenient than having to go pick up and find a hard copy, especially when it's done right from the handheld itself. The PSP Go is capable of connecting to the PS3 to share images, video, and even games (if you'd rather download from a hard-line connection instead of playing around with the PSP's wireless). It's also possible to use the PSP connection to play the PSP Go through the PS3 (as in, it shows up on a big screen). This is a neat idea, but the low resolution makes this not exactly worth it. On its own, the PSP Go is also capable of internet browsing, internet radio, and Skype. The PSP's price (roughly $200) is probably its hardest selling point. While this current price is better than it was in the past, it's still a pretty penny. The multimedia features seem intended to justify this, but they feel like more of a sideshow than the main event (since it's easier just to buy an MP3 player for those kinds of things). The PSP's library at this point is large enough to make it worth it, and the graphics are generally of a higher quality than the DS. In short, the PSP Go is a marked upgrade compared to the older model PSP, and works well on its own merits. Rating: 8/10. We purchased the PSP Go from a gaming store with our own funds.</td><td>Good for some, not for others</td><td>1290384000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>38735</td><td>5.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>11 22, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006JC44</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Whacked is a cartoony beat-em-up game that pits you against three opponents - and with XBox live, they can be anywhere in the world! At first glance, Whacked looks to be another version of Cel Damage, Super Smash Brothers Melee, or any of the many other cartoon-characters-bash-each-other-with-cartooney-weapons games that are on the market. You choose from a number of cartoon characters. You go into relatively small maps. You run around looking for weapons to kill each other with in cute ways. When you get into the game, though, you realize very quickly that this game IS really unique, a ton of fun, and not really intended for kids! The characters are each very special, and everyone I've played with has their own favorite. Toof's has a layer of teeth all the way around his head, and his entire head top lifts up when he wants to eat. Eugene is a picked-on flightless bird that dreams of revenge. Lucky is a rabbit who has lost his foot and is very grumpy. The characters are all drawn with a twisted sense of humor and you can tell that none of them are quite sane. Gameplay is straightforward. You get put onto a cartooney map with interactive parts. A kid's room has a train rolling around on a track that runs you over if you're not careful. A kitchen sink area has a garbage disposal which can cause some damage. There are numerous weapons scattered around the map, from electro-zappers to egg-firing guns to staple guns and single-shot rocket launchers. There's a toy tank in one level, but it won't work until you put a battery into it! In between levels are bizarre commercials and interviews with the characters. They're all on the twisted side. One commercial, with purposefully badly drawn artwork, simply goes, \"grind up a pig, put it in a can, Scrapple!\" while showing you a pig being ground up and dumped into a can. The commentary that goes along with the game is GREAT! If Lucky the Rabbit is doing well, the background might start singing, \"Kill the raaaabit, kill the raaaabit!\" If Charity bashes Lucky into a wall, you might hear, \"Charity got lucky today!\" That leads to one of my only negative comments on the game. It seems like it'd be a great game for young kids and teenagers, since there's no blood and it's all cartoon fun, but the language should make a parent think twice. The announcer talking about the prize for winning calls it a 'lap dance of fun.' One of the built-in responses (vocal) after being hit is \"If I had any feet, I'd kick your A%%.\" Going on line both increases greatly the fun you can have but also increases the amount of swearing you have to deal with. The XBox Live comes with a headset and many of the users seem to be teenagers that enjoy shocking others. The gameplay is fast and furious, and quite a fun challenge, but if you wear the headset you'll hear everything from non-stop swears to rambling commentary on sex and drugs. If you get a group of serious gamers it's great to taunt each other and congratulate great shots, but if you run into one of the attention-seekers, it might be good to just leave off the headset for a while. So for more mature audiences, I definitely recommend this game very highly! For the younger set, rent it if you're unsure, and judge for yourself if it's appropriate for their age level.</td><td>Great fun, but not for the kids</td><td>1037923200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>62183</td><td>5.0</td><td>7</td><td>false</td><td>11 22, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000066TSE</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Talk about an alphabet soup! NFL 2K3 on the PS2 or XBox is great on its own, and is even better when you go on line with your console to play teams around the world! We play both the Madden and NFL series of football games, and while both have come out with really amazing graphics and gameplay recently, there are definitely areas that NFL 2K3 shines in. First, the graphics. Football games on the PS2 and XBox both have pretty amazing graphics this year. The helmets reflect light, the uniforms and body shapes are right on, each character is properly modelled based on the real person. Add on to that great movement animation and even facial expressions after plays. The stadiums all look very realistic. You could probably fool someone into believing this was a real game at first glance, if they wandered into the room. Gameplay is great, and we really enjoy the play selection method. It's extremely easy to understand, and the graphics make it clear exactly what the players will be doing on each play. There's a good playbook to choose from, and you can design your own if you wish. In addition to the base plays, you can also do things like hurry up the team, to a fake pass and so on. During the play, your runner can hurdle over downed players and push himself for that extra burst of speed. It's great! As much as I enjoyed the fun of hearing Madden give commentary on the Madden version, it gets old VERY quickly. That is definitely not a problem here. You get to hear commentary from Dan Stevens and Peter O'Keefe of ESPN (as well as music and other such). Instead of the same thing over and over again, you actually hear things that relate to the plays, and they have a GIANT collection so that you rarely hear the same thing twice. And that would only be if you did the exact same thing two times! In addition to just playing a game, there are many other ways of playing NFL 2K3. You can own a franchise, and control everything from player contracts to the draft to swapping players mid-season. You can choose to play the games or just have the computer play them for you as you do a 'top-down' approach. You can also play a 'season' where you go from pre-season through the superbowl. Other options are tournament, where you create your own tournament of up to 16 teams, and practice, to help you understand plays in your playbook. There's even a situation mode, where you can create any situation you want. Want to figure out what to do on 3rd down, 2 minutes left in the 3rd quarter in the rain? This is the way to do it! There are many options in gameplay, besides just the teams and stadiums. You can set the weather, from no precipitation to 100%. You can set the temperature from 0-100F, which might turn that precipitation into snow. You can play in the daytime, evening or night. You can deal with injuries, fatigue, windspeed. You have your entire little world to customize! And if somehow all of that isn't enough for you, both the XBox and PS2 versions of the came can be played ON LINE. This means, if you have the adaptor for your system to connect to the internet, that you can play thousands of other players around the world, any time of the day or night! Players are ranked according to ability, so you can find an opponent well matched to you. See how well you rank against other real humans if you're feeling good about your skills!

It might seem easy at first, but soon you're caught up in the musical action! There are other games out there that make you 'dance to the beat' or hit buttons in rhythm. Frequency takes this to a new level by breaking up real songs into their components - guitar, drum, synth, etc - and letting you play along with ANY of the parts. Get strings of hits done properly to gain points, and tag special sequences to get multipliers or other bonusses. Advance through levels to unlock secrets, and increase the difficulty level on any song to challenge yourself further. These aren't 'generic beats' you're playing along with. You get to choose from No Doubt, Fear Factory, Orbital, Paul Oakenfold, Curve, The Crystal Method, and many more. So not only is the gameplay great, but the music you get to listen to is great, too! Design your own mixes of the songs, or even better, play the game with friends! The game truly shines when you take it into multiplayer. You can do that with extra controllers, or the best way to play is on line with the PS2 Online setup. Get three other players from around the globe to join you, and together you can really get a song to shine. It's amazingly fun to go from your own simple bassline and to hear the other players chime in with their parts. It's an on line jam session! Highly recommended for any music fan, and even those not heavily into music but who enjoy games like tetris and bubbles will find it quite addicting.</td><td>Great fun with great music</td><td>1037923200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>3956</td><td>4.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>11 22, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00000K2R4</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Dreamcast is the next generation of gaming machine from Sega, most well known for its Sonic the Hedgehog games. With Dreamcast, Sega moves beyond Sonic into a heavily graphic and net-savvy arcade machine. Probably the biggest difference between the Dreamcast and its competitors is the built in 56k modem. This allows Dreamcast owners to log on to the net, surf the web, and fight other opponents head to head. This opens up a HUGE opportunity for finding playmates that until now was restricted to computer gamers. The web surfing ability only sweetens the deal, although like WebTV, there is no ability to download. It's not for free - ... - but for a household that is currently not on the Internet, the price gets both the web access and unlimited gameplay. You also need to buy a keyboard if you wish to do any web work. Like the Sony Playstation, the Dreamcast will play audio CDs. Unlike the Playstation 2, it will not play DVDs, however. Also, while the Playstation 2 can play all Playstation games (since both are CD based) the Sega Dreamcast cannot play older Sega games. Popular Sega games tend to be arcade or fighting games - Rayman 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3. The incredibly high polygon draw rate (three million polygons per second) means that these games fly, giving great gameplay. Even though this is equipped with a 12x CD player, it's still slower than a cartridge system like the N64. On the up-side, CDs are cheaper than cartridges, and can hold a lot more information on them, leading to more involved games. I'm personally not a huge Dreamcast fan - the types of games available on it aren't ones that tend to appeal to me - but my arcade and fighting loving friends enjoy it a great deal.

This gave it the ability to hold more information than a normal cartridge game ... and many games came in multiple CD packs. This equalled longer gameplay and more complexity than the N64 or Sega systems. The Playstation One is a smaller version of the same unit - portable and soon to come out with a portable LCD screen. Both play any game from the Playstation One library. While CDs do hold more data than cartridges, they load a bit more slowly, so often there is a second lag between scenes as the new scene loads into memory. While Nintendo games tend to be pixel based, most Playstation games are polygon based, taking advantage of the Playstation's 360,000 polygons/sec speed. This tends to make images sharper and scaleable. When something moves towards you it's easy to calculate polygons, compared to expanding pixels. There is a good sized library of games for the Playstation - quite a few racing games, plus the Tomb Raider series, the Final Fantasy series, Abe, Spyro the Dragon, and more. The games for the Playstation tend to be for teenagers and adults. We've had a Playstation since it first came out, and for racing and sports games it is incredible. We find we use the N64 far more often when kids are around wanting to play something.

While FF8 was like playing characters in a well done anime movie, FF IX has you controlling rounded, playful looking characters that give the game more kid-appeal. The graphics in general are stellar. The opening sequence, the animation of water, of birds, of fire, and of other things normally challenging to an animation crew are amazing to watch. Gameplay graphics are quite good, although at times the pretty backgrounds can make finding an object or figuring out an exit to a room a bit difficult. FF IX is a bit restrictive in its characters. Your thief, mage, knight, and \"princess healer\" each need to pretty much specialize within their class. Each can find special items to help them learn and grow, and choose how to aim their growth. This can be done automatically for new players, or with great attention to detail for the more advanced gamers. Battle is also nice in this way - beginners can have the game pause while they choose exactly which magic to fire at their enemies, while those wanting a challenge can have the entire battle run in real time, depending on quick reflexes and fast fingers. In addition to the players, there are also 'helpers', or Eidolons, which add to the drama of a battle. Active Time Events (ATE) will show up occasionally to fill you in on the storyline, showing short movies of things happening elsewhere in the game. These are well done - if you've already seen a particular ATE from a different game, you can simply bypass these. Some ATEs help progress the plot, while others give the player help with new commands. In all, this is a great game for all playing levels. New and young gamers can set the game up so it gives you time to think during combat, and helps out out with skill setting. Advanced players can tweak all of the details themselves, and immerse themselves in the challenging card games that are part of the plot. There's something in it for everyone!</td><td>Less cinematic than 8, but still great playing fun for all</td><td>974851200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>19044</td><td>4.0</td><td>24</td><td>false</td><td>11 22, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00004YKHS</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>When we got a Playstation 2, the first PS2 game we put into it was Armored Core 2, by Agetec. This game style is definitely one we enjoy a great deal. Unfortunately, it appears they rushed this game out the door a bit too quickly. The game design is really neat. Like most mech games, you start out slowly, getting money to customize your mech as you go. There are 50 'ranked' robots for you to fight your way through, as well as 35 missions to undertake to earn fame and fortune. There are hundreds of parts to choose from to customize your bot. You can also go head-to-head by linking your PS2 to a friend's with the cable. Unfortunately the PS2 doesn't currently support modem play, so someone has to carry the unit to someone else's house to do this. The plots are interesting - with three factions trying to get control of Mars, the missions you choose help influence the fate of these companies.  The customization is almost overwhelming. You can custom-design your own logo with their built in paint program, buy parts for a huge variety of systems on your mech, and then test it out in various arenas against various foes. Why the disappointment, then? The learning curve on this is VERY steep - the screens and layout could have been done much more intuitively. The game also runs extremely slowly. Sounds lock up, visuals will stick on the screen, etc. If you've spent hours and hours (if not weeks and weeks) working on designing the perfect mech, the last thing you want is for system failures to cause you to lose missions and die in battles. A true mech fan might overlook these problems and enjoy the game, but those out to test the true power of their PS2 might want to look at other options.</td><td>Great for true Mech fans, a bit buggy for others</td><td>974851200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>20630</td><td>4.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>11 22, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000051WA5</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Definitely the most sought-after console of the holiday season.... What is this console, that demands this much attention? The Sony Playstation 2 is perhaps the best planned sequel machine of the ones being offered. It can play both audio CD and DVD movies. It can play EVERY Playstation 1 game, since both are CD-based systems. This gives it a built-in base library of hundreds of games. There are new games being created for the PS2. Current favorites are Madden 2001, which has INCREDIBLE graphics, and Tekken. With DVDs holding 4.7 GIG (compared to a CD holding 660 MEG) you can expect huge games in the near future, with incredible cinematic cut scenes. With a 24x CD-Rom (and 4x DVD player) the normal load time problems of CD-based systems are vastly minimized. With 48 channel sound, currently the best on the market, the PS2 has the best chance for killer soundtracks. Now it's up to the game designers to make use of it ... While the PS2 offers 75 million polygons/sec, the processor can't quite keep up with this, so the actual rate is somewhat less. Still, this is a pretty good clip compared to other console systems, so expect great graphics and fast gameplay if you are lucky enough to get your hands on one. We rented a PS2 when it first came out, and ironically enough we spent most of the first day playing Final Fantasy IX, a Playstation 1 game. The PS2 games we played were greatly enjoyable, with stellar sound and graphics. We enjoyed not only the new gaming features, but also the fact that our existing library of games still worked wonderfully. With the Playstation 2, the real question isn't if you want one, but can you get one, and if so, how much are you willing to pay to do so.

You are a muscular, well trained soldier wearing pounds of gear, armor and weapons - and it'll barely be enough to keep you alive. This game is compared frequently to Halo, but if Halo is the lighthearted ease of Star Wars, Gears of War is the non-stop assault and clinging to life of Alien. You're not jumping around like a kangaroo here, blasting at foes. You are heavily laden, crouching behind anything you can find to shield you, trying your best to stay alive for five more minutes. You have to work strategically with your fellow soldiers to climb forward every inch. The graphics in Gears of War are very impressive. The game is done in a palatte of browns, greys and reds. The dismal skies above, the swarms of black birds, the dented and dingy equipment - this is a world on the verge of despair. Enemies don't stand out with brightly colored costumes. You have to really pay attention to know where they are and to take them out. The sounds really help drive home the urgency of your mission. Voices cry out on all sides for help. The hammering of the machine guns and rapid fire weapons ring in your ears. The soundtrack is pounding and epic. If anything this is all TOO pounding - after playing this for weeks, I really can get a headache :) I'd turn it down, but then I wouldn't be able to tell where the enemies were sniping me from sometimes. The storyline really helps involve you in what is going on. It's like being at the center of a high power action movie. There are decisions you can make along the way to help guide the story. I really enjoy the \"fight for every inch of soil\" way it has you feel like you are involved in a real challenge. It might seem TOO challenging for some new gamers. Stick with it - it's well worth it. I do wish, with all of their emphasis on taking cover and being cautious - that you could CROUCH. I understand not being able to jump - you're wearing hundreds of pounds of gear! However, you can crouch behind cover. Why can't you crouch when you're not near cover, to lower your profile a bit? I think that would help out in some situations. Still, that's a minor complaint for a fantastic game. If you're a mature gamer (there's a fair amount of blood here) that enjoys shooters, definitely pick this one up!</td><td>A Must Have for the Mature Gamer</td><td>1164067200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>80573</td><td>5.0</td><td>80</td><td>false</td><td>11 21, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000F5IH2I</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Final Fantasy is sometimes thought of as a kiddy game with chocobos and moogles. Final Fantasy XII proves that this series can present an awesome storyline and graphics that all ages will adore. Don't worry if you haven't played all of the other Final Fantasy games. You don't need to. There are subtle carry-overs, but this game is meant to stand alone. You are a young orphan in a city recovering after a war. The cruel Empire has taken over your home town, and you enjoy causing trouble for the soldiers. Soon, of course, you're swept up in an epic rebellion. The storyline here is just *amazing*. Not just the plot itself, but the voice acting, the dialogue, the graphics, they are top notch. This is really like being a part of an extremely well done drama movie. They delve into issues of honor, loyalty, love, betrayal, and more. I'm an adult gamer, and I was staying up many long nights because I wanted to see where the story was going. Some of the subtle interactions between characters in cut scenes are just amazing. The small nods, the looks in their eyes, you are hard pressed to remember that they are animated in a computer game. Gameplay itself revolves around a party of characters going on quests, fighting in battles and moving through the large world. Each character gains experience and skills as they go. You buy them new weapons and armor, train them in spells, and aim them in their career growth however you wish. There is a dual system in play here. First, you need to physically own the weapon or item you wish to use - say an iron sword. But then you need to KNOW how to use it too! You can't just hand an iron sword to a 10 year old piano player and expect her to know how to use it. That skill is called a \"license\". You have an online license chart that lets you manage what each character knows. Licenses relate to each other. If your character learns the basics of sword work, now they can learn a more advanced version. It is very intuitive and adds a fun element to the game. It's not just one straight line that you choose and are stuck with. It's an all-directions layout where you can try new skills or expand out as you learn the system better. I really like combat in this Final Fantasy as well. Instead of random battles where enemies appear out of nowhere to assault you, all enemies are \"on the map\" with you. If you're running along a path in the desert and see something really scary in the distance, you run away from it! You don't have to worry about enemies springing up out of nowhere to slam you into the ground. The enemies in general are challenging but not impossible. There are spots where you really have to think about the enemy and what its weakness is to defeat it. You can't just brute force bash away at everything and hope to succeed. Still, as great as the gameplay is, and as gorgeous as the visuals and music and voice acting are, I really have to come back to the plot and characters as standing out here. There's been a lot of talk in the gaming world about a game that finally goes from \"little pixels on the screen\" that you move from X to Y to the point of *caring* about these characters, about what they are going through, and feeling emotional about their highs and lows. I really think Final Fantasy XII has hit that level. Yes, there are one or two twerpy characters that can be annoying. Even Star Wars had Luke whining about the Takashi Station at the beginning, to set his \"basis for growth\". In general, though, every single character here seems real, seems complex, and you don't want to put the game down. Highly, highly recommended.</td><td>Fantasic Storyline, Amazing Graphics, a Must Have</td><td>1164067200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>55270</td><td>5.0</td><td>138</td><td>false</td><td>11 21, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0001XE0OS</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I remember playing the original Bard's Tale game - it was a game I loved and played for months and months. This new version features the brilliant acting of Cary Elwes of Priness Bride frame! You get to create your bard character with the standard attributes - strength, dexterity and so on. But once you get into the game, you'll quickly discover the comic timing that makes this game so unique. You wander into a tavern and are promptly told to go search for rats. Your character asides that this is a rather cliche quest, but you'll do it for the (ahem) ample barmaid who smiles at you. You head down into the dusty cellar, where you find your rat and slay him. Then, as you get your little scene of the Bard's Victory, a HUGE rat sneaks up behind you and breathes on you with a massive fire breath! When you hobble up to the tavern, everyone is laughing their fool heads off. It's that sort of twist that makes the entire game hilarious, especially for RPG buffs. Every normal twist and turn of RPG campaigning is made fun of here. You are given the option of the \"nice\" or \"naughty\" option at every turn - and it's not always the \"nice\" option that you want to try! The game is very replayable, as you see what happens with various combinations of answers. There's plenty of combinations of fighting, spellcasting, healing and so on - in traditional RPG fashion. I particularly like the wiggly little magic spiders myself, as they remind me of the Spirited Away anime. But really the wit is the key feature of this game.

The GBA version is just as addictive - and can be played anywhere! The familiar, fun gameplay is here. You're a kid taking over a farm. The farm is in disrepair and needs help. You start out by weeding the garden, chopping the logs into boards and breaking up rocks. You slowly start growing crops, raising horses and chickens, and making a name for yourself. You might think this would get boring, but time is running all the time. You have to get food to your animals, play with them, keep your crops watered, get your field cleared, mine for supplies, go into town and chat it up with the local girls. There are the usual goodies - horse races, other festivals that come on certain days of the year. There are upgrades to your tools and little sprites that help you out with your tasks. You can fall in love with the girl of your dreams and build a life together. With lots of customizable names, from your farm to your dog to your horse, it really begins to feel like your own little world. The graphics are great, and while it's not a button-mashing extreme, the clock is always ticking so you get a sense that you have to get going with your life in order to feed yourself and your animals. There aren't goals to meet or points to score - there is a farm to tend to and responsibilities to manage. It's a great game for all ages and VERY rewarding. My one complaint about this game - and keep in mind that this is a HUGELY addictive game for me so I love it - is that it only lets you be a male. Why?? I would LOVE to be a girl on the farm who is dating boys. It can't be THAT hard to switch a few names and pixels. Why am I forced to be a boy? Why can't a girl run a farm? That being said, it's a ton of fun and well suited for the GBA.

I adore playing all of the Guitar Hero games, and we have multiple guitars in the house (for multiple platforms) so that we can jam together. When Harmonix turned over Guitar Hero III to another company, I was really curious what they would choose to do next. I am THRILLED with the result - Rock Band, which combines together all the fun of singing karaoke, playing guitar (lead and bass) plus DRUMS!!! My boyfriend is in several bands, and he plays lead guitar, bass guitar and drums. I love to sing. So we have played many, many games in all of these genres (including the Donkey Kong Konga game which is surprisingly fun). We were quite interested to see how the Harmonix guys would merge these variety of instruments into a single game. First, the instruments. The guitar is FAR better than the guitars previously released for Guitar Hero. The buttons are \"full fret\" making the much easier to press. You don't have that annoying ridge line. You get TWO sets of buttons in fact - one for easier guitar solo play. You have sound settings. I can't say enough about this guitar. The only thing it lacks is stickers :) Really, couldn't they include a sticker set or two, to customize the thing? A minor flaw :) The drum set is REALLY cool. It comes with a stand and it has a very nice feel to it. My boyfriend complained a bit about the wood sticks not being smooth, but heck, you're not paying for high quality sticks here. There is a four-plug USB hub so you can actually plug all these items into your XBox 360 :) And there's a few headset adaptors, and a microphone. We already had several of these. Now for gameplay. The graphics are visually lovely, although really, with up to four people playing and singing, the background stuff is pretty meaningless. The screen is taken up by all of the progress bars and alert bars and so on. I do have to comment that the customization for your characters is AWESOME. You customize their style of movement (punk, rock, etc), their facial look, hair style, eye color and much more. Plus you can buy all sorts of great outfits in the store. Never mind equipment. They really went overboard in this area. I found when I played an instrument whose track was on the far left (the lead guitar, for example) that I could easily see the \"overall progress\" bar showing how everyone in the band was doing. I could see that the drum guy was doing poorly and slipping down into the red. However, when *I* was playing the drums - and the visual for my drum track was on the far right - I had NO idea how well or poorly I was doing. That overall band progress display was on the far left (past the other instruments' tracks) and there was no way to watch both my own drum note list and see how I was doing at the same time. So you almost need to designate whoever is playing in that far left track as the \"band alert person\" to yell out if someone is doing not so well. The band works as a unit. If for example the drums are doing poorly, but the guitarist is doing well, the guitarist can use their energy the rev up the crowd which helps everyone in the band. So the guitarist can save the drummer, for example. On the other hand, if the drummer is really bad, after a few failures, the crowd gives up. You can't have the remaining players try to play the song out. Which brings up one of my only complaints about the game. Let's say you start a band \"Asia\" with the leader being a drummer. Now any time Asia wants to continue on their career, the drummer MUST BE PLAYING. In real life, band members change positions sometimes. You have a drummer who also likes to sing. But here, if you have a position set as the leader, the game can't be played (with that band and the songs it's unlocked) without that instrument being played. We found that really annoying. You should be able to say that person X now wants to play instrument Y and keep going. Now, interestingly, my boyfriend plays the drums. He found the drum pads AWFUL to use and thought they were broken. We swapped off and he took over guitar while I played with the drums. I did a 100% performance. So it's something about the way you hit them. I *think* they have to be hit pretty close to dead center, with a sharp rap. I'm not a drummer so undoubtedly I'm not hitting them \"technically right\" but I am able to sail through many songs on easy with 100%. So it's a matter of getting used to how they work. The vocal / mike track is much like any karaoke game, and you \"yell\" to activate overdrive. It's a lot of fun. I did try several songs with a mike stand setup so I could play guitar and sing at the same time. It was a lot of fun - but part of the mike track is \"cowbells\" where you're supposed to thwap the microphone in time to the beat. Unfortunately if you're busy playing the guitar or drums you no longer can thwap the microphone. I tried yelling \"POP\" and it worked about half the time, if I used a very snappy sound to my POP. Still, it's a shame you can't sing and play because of this. The songs in this list are GREAT. I really love some of them, and there were few that I simply didn't like at all. It's cool that they have multiple venues per location, instead of the Guitar Hero games where there was just \"one Boston\" and so on. You have to actually earn a Van or Bus or whatever to move on to a new city. You actually build up a fan base as you go, and lose it if you do poorly. That is all very cool. On the down side, the progression of songs is rather odd. You can play 2 songs you like in Boston, and then go to Chicago and play the exact two songs again to earn more stars there. The songs seem to unlock slowly. I'm also not overly fond of several modes where you have no idea what songs are coming up until 2 seconds before the songs begin. They do have a training mode and solo mode, but really you figure the great appeal of this game is to play with your friends, using the various instruments. So we found that interface - where you are stuck with a single leader, and it is very much one-person-one-instrument oriented, to be a bit frustrating. Sure, I love playing drums - but I love playing guitar too! Sometimes I love to sing. It didn't seem like it should be THAT bad to let a person switch instruments once you'd unlocked a bunch of venues and songs. Finally, I really like that right from the start you have access to all difficulty modes, and can set them by person. So if you have a really great guitarist in your family, and someone who is perhaps younger or just getting started, the great guitarist can set themselves to difficult and the younger person can set to easy and both can have a really fun, challenging time. I am really looking forward to new song downloads too, and imagine that could make this game last years and years and be just as much fun. Highly, highly recommended if you can get your hands on this thing. We were there right when the store opened to get our hands on ours, and it sold out immediately. Well worth tracking down!! Note that I have photos of the instruments on my website and am happy to answer any other questions you guys have about this game.</td><td>Harmonix Delivers another Slam Dunk</td><td>1195516800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>165793</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>11 2, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0019SMCDU</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>How many DDR games can they make? DDRX brings a new, urban video-based look to the DDR game, but in the end it really comes down to if you enjoy the songs and dancing to them. I have five DDR games and I have an area of my basement set up with the PS2, the pile of games and the dance pad. I don't tend to play \"one game\" (in terms of DDR). If I head downstairs to dance, I play a few songs on one game, swap games, play a few songs on the next one and so on. I get a lot of chances to compare them all against each other, the benefits and downsides of each one. DDR X is certainly shinier than the other games. They are pushing the PS2 to its limits with the graphics here. Really, though, who is watching the graphics when they are dancing? Yes, I love having the treadmill-dancing video running for OK Go (and missed half the steps the first time I danced it because I was having so much fun watching the video). Which sort of proves my point - if you are watching or paying attention to anything other than the arrows, you'll be in trouble :) Since the arrows really don't change from game to game, all that really matters is the song list. This is a VERY subjective judgment. We all have quite different musical tastes. For example, in DDR X there are four songs I really like - and I'm not really fond of the others. I'm sure other players will have a completely separate list of songs in this game they adore. That's why it's nice to have so many options in the game, so that you can pick out the ones you like and ignore the ones you don't like. I'm really glad they continue to come out with games for the PS2 to continue out the DDR game line. I like the steps and songs in my various DDR games and am always glad to be able to add more games into my workout mix. I'm sure at some point with the PS3 they'll come out with a DDR that lets you download songs and old step sets from the old DDR games, and at that point I might convert up to the PS3. In the meantime, though, this is a great option. I definitely recommend anyone who wants to get a good balance and cardio workout to look into DDR, look at the song set list for each one and choose a few that you enjoy. DDR isn't about just having one and playing only it all the time. It's about having a few, with songs you like, and enjoying the songs. DDRX is definitely a great addition to the library. Well recommended.</td><td>Fun New Songs for a Great Game</td><td>1225584000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>164527</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 2, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0018BELN2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The usual problem with console based party games is that newcomers to a console have problems using the controllers. There are all sorts of odd buttons and they feel at a loss compared with people who have used the controllers regularly. Buzz gets completely around this issue by providing four \"easy to use\" controllers, battery powered (two AA batteries each, not included). You plug a tiny receiver unit into the USB port of your PS3 and then the four wireless controllers are used by the players. This is brilliant. It means any random person can play without any issue. There's a giant red buzzer and then four colored bars for making selections. Easy, understandable! The game itself is rather cute. You get to choose from a variety of characters to represent yourself, then choose a costume. Each character has his or her own voice and movements. The moderator has unique sayings he makes about each character, too. You even get to choose what type of \"sound\" your buzzer makes. On to gameplay. There are a series of rounds, each different. Sometimes you just need to answer correctly and it doesn't matter if you take a long time. Sometimes your speed does make a difference. There are photo questions, reading questions, questions about science, modern movies, oldies songs, and everything else in between. Each round one of the players chooses the topic area so you can tailor the game to match your interests. The tracking on the controller is rather impressive. There are numerous times that one of us was in the range of 0.06 seconds behind the other and the system knew that. It really was a lot of fun to play. Sure, some of the character activities are \"silly\" - but that's typical in games like this. All in all, a great party game, and it certainly would be fun if you're a trivia buff and just want to play on your own. Still, it's really meant to be played with multiple people, either online or in person. There's even the ability to create your own quizzes if you want! Well recommended for trivia fans! As a side note, if you have 10 minutes to kill, let the credits actually \"run\" at the end of a game. It is scary how slowly and long these things go for.

The nunchuck is not the main controller unit for the Wii. The Wii primarily uses the Wii Remote, shaped like a TV remote, for its functionality. The Nunchuck is for use in the \"other hand\" (i.e. your left hand if you're right handed) just for a few games. It plus into the bottom end of the Wii Remote with a cable that's about 2 1/2 feet long. Most of the time, you leave it unplugged and sitting by the console. For example, in the sports pack that comes with the Wii, only one of the five games uses the nunchuck. This is the boxing game. You use the nunchuck to hit with your off hand, just as you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your primary hand. The nunchuck has the same motion sensing technology as the Wii remote does, so that you can move your hand around and the game knows what you are doing. The buttons are much simpler - there is a Z big trigger button, a smaller C trigger button above it, and then a joystick up on top. For some games, no buttons are used at all. The cable length is designed so you don't trip yourself with it :) It's long enough that if you held your hands apart, you could easily ride even a wide-handled bike. It's not long enough that you could put both arms straight out to the left and right, though. I've never had any problems with the cable length hindering me. None of the games require you to have your hands far apart. In boxing, for example, your hands are always near each other and there's plenty of cable length even when you're jabbing. The nunchuck doesn't need its own power - it plugs into the Wii remote controller when it's in use. So there's no worry about charging up or batteries. I would definitely have at least one functional nunchuck for my Wii, and if you're really into multiplayer two-handed games like boxing matches, then having two would be important.

You wave it around, and your on-screen character waves their wand! This isn't an add-on controller - this is the actual, standard controller that most if not all games on the Nintendo Wii use as their primary control unit. There is also a \"nunchuck\" that can be used in your off hand, but many games don't use the nunchuck. The aim of the Wii was to make gaming as simple and intuitive as possible for the casual non gamer. Pretty much every person with a TV is comfortable using a TV remote. You point, you click. The Wii Remote Controller works in the same fashion. The motion sensors know what you are doing with the remote. If you're playing a baseball game, you swing at the ball. If you're playing a bowling game, you bring your arm back and swing it forward. Everything \"makes sense\". A sword swing? A light saber battle? Just move your arm and the character does the same thing. There are only two buttons that really matter. There's an A button on the front that you push for most operations. There's also a trigger underneath that is the B button. Depending on the game, they will have you use one or the other button. There are also a few other buttons for more complex gaming. There's a D-pad. A \"home\" button lets you go instantly back to the main Wii menu if you're tired of playing. There's a plus and minus button, a 1 and 2 button. There's even a power button. You don't have to walk over to your Wii any more to turn it on or off. Just hit the power button on the remote and you're all set. The remote runs on two AA batteries, so there's no USB plugging in or charging up, as with the other systems' remotes. You do get a wrist strap, though, so the Wii remote doesn't fly out of your hands while you're doing a super powerful golf swing. There's even a speaker in the remote! This is great if you're playing a game against another player. Say I'm boxing my boyfriend and I am the winner. *My* remote says that I triumphed, to me. Neat! I definitely love the Wii remote controller. It's light, it's super easy to use, it's intuitive and I can just pop batteries into it when it runs out, instead of having to wait for a recharge. Highly recommended. Just note that if you want to play a game that needs a nunchuck as well, that you have to buy that separately.</td><td>Light, Intuitive, Easy to Use</td><td>1163894400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>88448</td><td>5.0</td><td>53</td><td>false</td><td>11 19, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000GA75TI</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Marvel Ultimate Alliance lets you play with a team of your favorite superheroes. Choose from Wolverine, Spider-Man, Thing, Storm, and many others! You can sort of consider this a Diablo style game with a much more upbeat style. You are one of four characters on the screen at any time, and can quickly flip through them. You go through the rooms hacking, slashing, slashing, and then hacking some more. Along the way you grab colored orbs and glowing coins to help you level up your own character and unlock goodies. It's disappointing that at the beginning your four starting characters are Spider-Man, Thor, Wolverine, and Captain America. As much as I like those guys, couldn't ONE of them have been female? Still, it's only maybe 10 minutes later that you get to the \"team switching\" spot and can begin to design your own team. They're not stingy with the characters. Right from this point you can immediately begin to use spider-woman, deadpool, iceman, colossus, elektra, human torch, iron man, thing, luke cage, invisible woman, storm, mr. fantastic, ms marvel, and moon knight. There's also other unlockable characters that you can get as you go. Each character can be levelled up to gain new abilities and outfits. You can choose characters that \"traditionally\" (in comic book stories) work together, and they will actually know to do combos in gameplay. The characters personalities really shine through in the cut scenes. Wolverine is stand-offish and a bit arrogant. Spiderman cracks jokes the entire time. Captain America feels he's in charge. I realize that it would be IMPOSSIBLE for them to have redone the cut scenes for every single combination of characters that you could have done! So again, I wish they had a woman in the set :) Maybe kick out Spidey and his incessant comments ... The graphics are rather good, from the flickering flame to the shadows and reflections. This isn't a game of subtleties, though. No textured fabrics or flower petals here. Everything is shiney and plasticky. On the sound side, it's a comic book adventure. You have incredibly cliched dialogue given by over-the-top voices, and lots of booming going on. It's to be expected. The storyline is also a traditional comic book story but heck, we all grew up with them! You're saving the world. Depending on how well you play, you achieve that mission to different degrees. They did a great job getting you to replay it over and over again in order to unlock the best ending you can. I really give the game great kudos for their multiplayer and online options. If you're playing at home, you can easily co-op in four people, one for each character, and go to town. There aren't many games where four people can easily have great fun playing together. For online, the same is true - you can really have a lot of fun conquering levels as a wide range of characters, interacting with players all over the world. This isn't a heavy thinking game, and it doesn't involve complex concepts. Instead, it's a game that adults can easily play with kids, and that can give you a few hours of fun relief from the real world.

At only $250, it provides motion sensing controllers which are great fun - and 480p graphics which aren't as good as our other two systems. The Wii is designed around a menu of \"channels\". These make it very easy for even a non-gamer to start using the console quickly. There is of course the game-playing channel, where the Wii will play any Wii or GameCube game. Simply load the disc in and go - it's a simple front-loading \"slot\", no carriage to break. There is a Mii channel where you set up a profile and avatar to connect to all your game playing, with many cute options. You can even make your Mii thin or thick. The Photos channel lets you look at photos on your TV, although its loading options are limited. Other channels for news, weather, and online shopping require an interent connection, and at least at launch aren't available yet. The system does NOT have a regular network cable port, which both the PS3 and XBox 360 have. Instead, it works with built in wireless or with a USB network adapter. I am a firm proponent of wireless - less clutter! So I am thrilled that they offer wireless automatically. With the PS3, you have to pay the extra $100 for the 60 gig unit to get this built in. The XBox 360 doesn't have it at all. We had our wireless up and running in about 5 minutes. It's hard to generalize gameplay on any console - it really depends on what games you buy. That being said, the comes-with-it software of Sports is really quite fun to play and is about as basic as you can get. We've had 8 year olds and adults try it out and really enjoy it. You swing at baseballs, lob tennis balls, bowl, box and play golf. A \"fitness\" mode puts you through a variety of tasks and then calculates your fitness age, sort of like how Brain Age keeps track of your mental age. If you did both every day, you could aim to be as fit mentally and physically as possible! In a world where video games = couch potato, it really is quite amazing to have a game where it natively expects you to move and be active. You don't lounge back and gain pounds here while playing games. Boxing can be quite strenuous, jabbing, blocking and weaving in real life. Tennis involves quick reflexes and strong arm movements. Bowling might be the most relaxed of the sports, but even there you are standing, moving, swinging. You get your heart going at least a little, and get some exercise. My boyfriend found his arms were sore after a few hours of fun gaming. The 480p resolution is certainly not high def 1080p like our other two systems. It's something you accept when you're paying such a low price for the console. But really, it's not that big a deal. I still play the old Zeldas and love them for their gameplay, even though you can't see the pores in Link's face. If they are going for the cartooney characters and environments, 480p is DVD quality and is quite good. If you really, really crave high definition super realism in your games, then the Wii might not be the best choice for you. However, if you're fine with playing games with a more impressionist / cartooney look to them, the 480p can show that quite nicely. For example, in Wii baseball, there aren't fans in the bleachers - just colored blocks. Nintendo has always been known as a \"Kid's Console\" - but I really do think with the Wii that they have become a \"Family Console\". It's not just kids who will enjoy this. Seniors can have fun bowling without knowing anything \"Tricky\" about how to use a video game unit. It's very intuitive. Moms can easily play with their kids, each with their own Wii profile. Adults having parties can have fun passing the controllers around. Family groups can share slideshows on the big screen while hanging out and drinking wine. With the price tag being so low, a gaming household that \"needs\" a higher end system can easily save up their money to get that XBox 360 or PS3 - and still be able to justify the $250 to get a Wii for the fun, casual gaming stuff to share with their non-gaming friends.

I do highly recommend them. I just do not recommend THESE pillowcases. I've been testing them for quite a while now and my opinion has solidified the longer I've used it. First, I take issue with their marketing pushing that this is \"charmeuse silk\" as if that is a type of silk. It's not. It's a type of WEAVE that is made with silk, and they don't say anywhere at all (that I can find) what type of silk it is. Mulberry silk comes from mulberry silkworms. We have no idea what this silk is. There's not a \"charmeuse silk\". I have to believe this is NOT mulberry silk. It's definitely much rougher and not as comfortable as the mulberry silk pillowcases I have. I can understand why people who had previously slept on cotton or such might feel this is better - but it is nowhere near what a proper silk pillowcase would feel like. Silk should always be washed by hand in cold water and let to air dry. When cared for properly, silk won't fall apart. I have to believe that the people having issues with their pillowcases are tossing them into the laundry on hot. I haven't had any with mine. I definitely recommend spending a little more money and getting a solid quality mulberry silk pillowcase. Then make sure you hand wash them so they last. It's worth the extra few dollars - it makes an enormous difference on your quality of sleep.

Each is good at specific tasks. Here is a fully unbiased review of how the PS3 performs as a next generation console unit. To start with, the PS3, like the XBox 360, supports full high definition. The Wii only supports a lower resolution. Since the Wii has a much lower price tag, that is a fair trade-off for people with a tighter budget. Gamers for whom a very high level of graphic detail is important will have to pony up for that ability. Along the same lines, the XBox 360 supports the HD format of high definition DVDs for movies, while the PS3 supports the Blu-ray format. If you haven't been following the whole format war for high definition DVDs, I have several articles on the topic on my gaming site. In short it's like the VHS/Beta wars when the VCR first came out. Is one better than the other? Will one format win out as the sole survivor? There's no way to tell. People will argue vehemently that one is better than the other. From a gaming point of view, the PS3 has the Blu-ray BUILT IN meaning every game can have 50 GIGS worth of game information. Think MASSIVELY huge maps, types of characters, etc. The XBox 360 only uses \"regular\" DVDs as its base game holder, which is 7 GIG. That is much smaller. You can buy an add-on HD DVD unit for about $100 but the storage is still smaller than Blu-ray - about 30 gig. People will argue about graphics until they're blue :) A lot of this comes down to how a specific game company *uses* the ability of the system. Looking at graphics on a tetris-like game will be much different than viewing the graphics of Oblivion or Gears of War. I found 360 graphics amazing on Oblivion. I equally found the PS3 graphics quite impressive on Genji's cut scenes (no enemy crabs in sight). Since both are high definition, I think that both have the same potential in real life terms. Both really shine in terms of fluid motion, precise detail and realism. I've seen it on both systems, on certain games. I've also seen junky graphics on both systems. Both are much better than the Wii. How about sound? All of these can plug into your stereo system. My boyfriend and I are both musicians. We have decibel meters and other sound-sensing tools. All three systems can create amazingly complex sounds, music, and in general a \"gaming environment\". Again I think it comes down to specific game makers, how they choose to use or not use that ability. It also comes down to how much you the gamer spent on your stereo system :) Speaking of sound, I do have to comment that our 360 is quite loud when it runs, despite our many attempts to help it be quieter. The PS3 right out of the box is MUCH quieter. Score 1 point for the PS3. On the general operating system for the units, all three consoles are going for more of a \"general use entertainment system\" presentation. The XBox has customizeable tabs that let you download new games, manage your environment and so on. The Wii also has channels that let you organize your gaming world. The PS3 has an interface almost exactly like that of the PSP, complete with cool drifting smoke waves in the background. You choose which area you want to work on - game, music, internet connection etc., and drop down to alter whatever feature you're interested in. So on to the on-line aspect, which most gamers are now fully interested in. Where the XBox 360 makes you buy an external connector for wireless, the PS3 has that built-in on the 60 gig model. The 20 gig model still requires an external connector (these run about $100). All will let you plug in a cable if you're still running a wired household. As a side comment on that, the XBox 360 has a 20 gig hard drive. However, they take up about 12 gig of that with their base system. So really you get 8 gig \"free\" for other things. Now, 8 gig might sound like a lot. But I still remember when the PS2 first came out and everyone was raving about the 8mb memory cards, how you could never possibly fill one of those up. We now have 8 memory cards and all are pretty much full. I have no doubt that 8 gig or even 20 gig is going to fill quickly. With the PS3 you at least do have that option for the 60 gig and it is really worth it. With the 360 your only option is to get an add-on drive to in essence back up the content you're not currently using and free up the main drive. How does the online world work on the PS3? The XBox definitely has the advantage here. Until this generation, *only* the XBox had a thriving community in their live world. The XBox 360 connected right into that XBox Live world, and they boast a *huge* community of gamers who actively gain points, play online and form virtual worlds. The PS3 and Wii both have to play catch-up at this point. Even if they have better interfaces, it's a matter of converting over all those players who have clans, familiarity and high point collections on the XBox world. Imagine if a new MMORPG came out right now that had fantastic graphics. Sure it might be wonderful - but will you really get all 800 trillion WOW players to drop their world and characters and friends to convert, especially if it costs more? It'll be a hard, slow sell. My summary? I definitely think all three have great games and that all three are worth owning. Of course I'm in a position that I *can* afford all three, which many people are not in. For example, I *love* the Zelda series, and I *love* the Final Fantasy series. I would be hard put to tell a person \"you need to get Zelda instead of Final Fantasy\". I would want the person to have both, because both are great for different reasons. If you really truly can only save up for one of the three consoles this holiday season, it isn't going to come down to which console is \"best\" for all players in some sort of a global way. It is going to come down to which console is best for YOU based on your specific gaming style. If you're on a really tight budget and just want something better than the previous generation, go for a Wii. It's cheap, the graphics are better, and the remotes are great fun. It has Zelda :) If you have a larger budget and really want the high definition, you're now choosing between the 360 and the PS3. You really do have to look at the specifics of each, and think seriously about your gaming style, to see which matches you best. If I were to make a flip summarization, if you really love online gameplay, I'd go with the XBox 360. Its years of head-start really give it a robust environment here. If you are looking for more of a home-based media center for your MPs3, photos and huge world gameplay, I'd go with the PS3. It definitely has the advantage on large scale games. Feel free to email me if you have more specific questions, or for screenshots, graphic descriptions, or interface information on any of the three systems.</td><td>Unbiased Review from someone who has all 3</td><td>1163808000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>94834</td><td>5.0</td><td>138</td><td>false</td><td>11 18, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000JLIXIG</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Resistance - Fall of Man is a first person shooter that combines World War II era environments with Doom-like horrific enemies to fight. It also offers great online multiplayer gameplay. The plot is that, around the time of World War II, enemies attacked the world, starting with Russia and moving westward through Europe and England. In the 50s, the US launched a counter-attack, landing in England. You're fighting, at least to start with, with WWII era weapons and outfits through the streets of England. Let's start with the graphics. The game goes for a very Call of Duty style of look - not quite realistic, more \"cartooney\" or stylized. Textures are smoothed out, some objects are simplified. That's not to say this is a Disney kiddie look. The monsters are grimey and nasty looking, the war-torn streets are very gritty. If anything, because this is set in a WWII type atmosphere, much of the game is brown, grimy and shell-shocked. The HUD is reasonably well done and not intrusive. A small series of bars on the left indicates your health. An equally small but useful display on the right tracks your ammo, magazines and grenades. The sound leans towards epic thundering scores, a la Gladiator or Conan. Players who love heavy rock music might not enjoy this, but I actually love this kind of music. I own both of the soundtracks I mentioned :). So to me, this really draws you into the atmosphere. The yells, gun noises and so on seem relatively realistic to help you feel you're really in the middle of a fight. I also like that, during gameplay, it's usually done without music. If I'm trying to sneak somewhere and listen for enemy movement, I don't want that objective made difficult by a soundtrack. Gameplay itself is typical FPS fare. You can crouch, jump over things, zoom in on your enemy, throw grenades, strafe, and so on. Your friends and enemies are rather good about taking cover and not just rushing an enemy head-on. There are a few situations which seem quite scripted - if your pals are meant to die, you could play perfectly and take out every enemy quickly and your friends will still be killed by mysterious off-screen snipers. Still, the game needs to keep you on course for the plot so this is to be expected. Checkpointing is reasonably good, although sometimes it sends you further back then you might like to start again. Healing is done via canisters you find, but depending on your skill you might wish there were more canisters scattered around :). That's why they have 3 levels of difficulty here. The interactivity with your environment is pretty impressive. Say your enemy is hiding behind a car. You can shoot out the car's windows and then shoot the enemy through the open space. Or you can shoot the car to damage it, and have it explode a la the infamous 'red exploding barrels' found in most shooting games. If you shoot at a window a few times, it will first crack, then pieces will fall out. Not only is the game great in single player mode, but you can play co-op with a friend at your home, or online in larger groups with friends or strangers from around the world. This helps turn the game from a play-for-a-few-months-at-home style game to a play-eternally-with-friends-online game.

The speaker talked about how it portrayed authentic feudal Japanese battles - involving Giant Enemy Crabs :) He also talked about novel concepts such as \"attacking its weak point for maximum damage\" and how you could do (gasp) REAL TIME weapons change in the game. This last item actually looks very silly - you could be swinging one sword, hit a button and MID SWING the sword changes into a new weapon. In general, this is a fighting game set in PRE feudal Japan, i.e. 1187. I ran a Feudal Japan newsletter for many years, and feudal Japan was the 1500s, the days of Oda Nobunaga and the wars then. Back in 1187, there was a quite different government setup. If you're curious about this time period, read The Tale of Genji sometime by Lady Murasaki - this is acclaimed by many as the first novel ever written. It was written back in the 11th century! It's a great read even today, which is quite an achievement. So back to the gameplay. You play a young two-sword warrior and have as your pals an older warrior, a female warrior and a war-god turned spellcasting warrior :) You fight through various Japanese landscapes and settings, taking on the Bad Guys. You have your combat techniques and magical powers to help you triumph. The graphics are very impressive. In the cut scenes, you can see the fabric weaves on the layers of kimono, the metallic sparkle in the lacquerware, the rippling heat waves by the fire. During gameplay the character movements were fluid and natural.  Fabric pieces would sway and tiny, glistening sparks would float on the air.  Some scenes were really quite lovely in a painting sort of way. Gameplay itself involves slicing with swords, chaining up attacks and blocking. There are, a la the Giant Enemy Crab, situations where you have to Attack the Weak Point for Maximum Damage. I didn't like the HUD of the map in the top left - it took up too much space and looked \"silly\" in almost a PacMan kind of way. The top left HUD of characters and health was much better done, less intrusive. For sound, I love Japanese culture and really enjoyed the traditional music that played in the background in many scenes. For me it really helped immerse the game in an authentic setting. Many of the characters speaking are obviously Japanese and hearing that accent and proper pronunciation of historic names was great. Some have British accents ... odd. There were a lot of little details that I really enjoyed. Obviously these guys had done their research. The little click as a sword was reset into its scabbard, the traditional sword holders on the ground, the way the swordsmen would set up a stance and move, it was all really enjoyable to watch. In many ways it was like being in a well done movie. That all being said, they took a few liberties about what the buildings looked like, and the characters dressed like, back in 1187. It was more like a time traveller from the feudal Japan period (i.e. the 1500s) went back to 1187 in some cases :) But that's sort of like the movie Excalibur, where King Arthur and his knights were wearing armor from the 1600s England. Historic King Arthur certainly wasn't alive in the 1600s :) But we accept that anachronism as part of the myth. It's not like the Japanese soldiers in 1187 had magic powers, either. In general I really love this game. If I'm going to pick out a particular flaw, it's the camera. You can't control the camera at all, and there are situations where it becomes incredibly annoying. Still, that's something you can just resign yourself to while you enjoy the game!</td><td>Great Graphics, Great Gameplay, Giant Enemy Crabs</td><td>1163808000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>95014</td><td>5.0</td><td>168</td><td>false</td><td>11 18, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000K1CS5Y</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The PlayStation 3 controller has gotten a lot of press because of its lack of vibration. However, it is wireless, extremely light, and has tilt sensors in it. This seems a great trade-off during gameplay. First, let's get through the \"bad\" that many people have gotten upset about. They took out the rumble controller from the PS3 controller. This was for legal reasons - a company which developed that rumble technology took issue with Sony using it. Some people feel it really affects gameplay not to have that rumbling. I have to admit that I am VERY happy, personally, that the rumbling is gone. I always turned off the rumble in games where I could. I am on my computer pretty much 24 hours a day, and if I play a game with rumble on, it *kills* my wrists.  If you're a rumble fan, this is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. Now, to the good parts of the controller. First, they all come wireless for the PS3. I *love* love wireless. Wires cause huge clutter in our living room, with all our systems and equipment. You only have to plug the controller in to power it up. It's a regular USB power-up so you can use your iPod's plug (assuming you have an iPod) or plug it into your computer or XBox 360 or anything else with a USB on it. That is to say, you don't have to power it up from your PS3 if you don't want to for some reason. Next, it is super light! I imagine this is because it doesn't have to hold the motors that cause rumbling. I really appreciate the lightness. You might not notice if you only play a game for an hour or two, but if you're doing marathon sessions of multiple hours, the weight of the controller really does begin to matter. Just like the Wii controllers, this controller has a tilt sensor in it. It actually knows when you tilt and turn the controller, or shake it. Depending on the game, you can use those tilts to look around or to shake off an enemy. That really gives you much more interactivity with the game, much more than button pushing. The general controller shape is exactly the same as the PS2 controller. You have a pair of shoulder buttons on each side, two joysticks, four buttons on the right and four directional buttons on the left. There's a PS button in the center, just like there's an XBox button in the middle of the Xbox 360 controller. Also, there are four lights on the unit, to let you know if this controller is #1, #2, #3 or #4 if you are playing multi-player games. The center PS button lets you turn the unit on and off, which is great if your console is off in a shelf or corner of the room. In general, I think they did a great job with the PS3 basic controllers. The main console sale both for 20 and 60 comes only with one controller - so be sure to get yourself a second one!</td><td>Wireless, No Rumble, but Light with Tilt Sensors</td><td>1163808000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>68976</td><td>5.0</td><td>2403</td><td>false</td><td>11 18, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009VXAM0</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>We got our hands on an XBox 360, a PS3, and a Wii on launch day. Each is good at specific tasks. Here is a fully unbiased review of how the PS3 performs as a next generation console unit. To start with, the PS3, like the XBox 360, supports full high definition. The Wii only supports a lower resolution. Since the Wii has a much lower price tag, that is a fair trade-off for people with a tighter budget. Gamers for whom a very high level of graphic detail is important will have to pony up for that ability. Along the same lines, the XBox 360 supports the HD format of high definition DVDs for movies, while the PS3 supports the Blu-ray format. If you haven't been following the whole format war for high definition DVDs, I have several articles on the topic on my gaming site. In short it's like the VHS/Beta wars when the VCR first came out. Is one better than the other? Will one format win out as the sole survivor? There's no way to tell. People will argue vehemently that one is better than the other. From a gaming point of view, the PS3 has the Blu-ray BUILT IN meaning every game can have 50 GIGS worth of game information. Think MASSIVELY huge maps, types of characters, etc. The XBox 360 only uses \"regular\" DVDs as its base game holder, which is about 7 GIG. That is much smaller. You can buy an add-on HD DVD unit for about $100 (shop around - they're there at that price) but the storage is still smaller than Blu-ray - about 30 gig. People will argue about graphics until they're blue :) A lot of this comes down to how a specific game company *uses* the ability of the system. Looking at graphics on a tetris-like game will be much different than viewing the graphics of Oblivion or Gears of War. I found 360 graphics amazing on Oblivion. I equally found the PS3 graphics quite impressive on Genji's cut scenes (no enemy crabs in sight). Since both are high definition, I think that both have the same potential in real life terms. Both really shine in terms of fluid motion, precise detail and realism. I've seen it on both systems, on certain games. I've also seen junky graphics on both systems. Both are much better than the Wii. How about sound? All of these can plug into your stereo system. My boyfriend and I are both musicians. We have decibel meters and other sound-sensing tools. All three systems can create amazingly complex sounds, music, and in general a \"gaming environment\". Again I think it comes down to specific game makers, how they choose to use or not use that ability. It also comes down to how much you the gamer spent on your stereo system :) Speaking of sound, I do have to comment that our 360 is quite loud when it runs, despite our many attempts to help it be quieter. The PS3 right out of the box is MUCH quieter. Score 1 point for the PS3. On the general operating system for the units, all three consoles are going for more of a \"general use entertainment system\" presentation. The XBox has customizeable tabs that let you download new games, manage your environment and so on. The Wii also has channels that let you organize your gaming world. The PS3 has an interface almost exactly like that of the PSP, complete with cool drifting smoke waves in the background. You choose which area you want to work on - game, music, internet connection etc., and drop down to alter whatever feature you're interested in. So on to the on-line aspect, which most gamers are now fully interested in. Where the XBox 360 makes you buy an external connector for wireless, the PS3 has that built-in on the 60 gig model. The 20 gig model still requires an external connector (these run about $100). All will let you plug in a cable if you're still running a wired household. [UPDATED JUNE 2007] Back during launch, people thought 20 gig was great and that 60 gig was overkill for a gaming system. After all, the XBox 360 had 20 gig as their top end. Now, only a few months later, Sony has discontinued their 20 gig as \"too small\". XBox has the Elite model with 120 gig. The difference is as that gamers are converting their focus from audio storage to video storage, and high def video at that. People are downloading and enjoying movies and TV shows on their consoles. It's something to consider, if you will be doing that with your console. How does the online world work on the PS3? The XBox definitely has the advantage here. Until this generation, *only* the XBox had a thriving community in their live world. The XBox 360 connected right into that XBox Live world, and they boast a *huge* community of gamers who actively gain points, play online and form virtual worlds. The PS3 and Wii both have to play catch-up at this point. Even if they have better interfaces, it's a matter of converting over all those players who have clans, familiarity and high point collections on the XBox world. Imagine if a new MMORPG came out right now that had fantastic graphics. Sure it might be wonderful - but will you really get all 800 trillion WOW players to drop their world and characters and friends to convert, especially if it costs more? It'll be a hard, slow sell. My summary? I definitely think all three have great games and that all three are worth owning. Of course I'm in a position that I *can* afford all three, which many people are not in. For example, I *love* the Zelda series, and I *love* the Final Fantasy series. I would be hard put to tell a person \"you need to get Zelda instead of Final Fantasy\". I would want the person to have both, because both are great for different reasons. If you really truly can only save up for one of the three consoles, it isn't going to come down to which console is \"best\" for all players in some sort of a global way. It is going to come down to which console is best for YOU based on your specific gaming style. If you're on a really tight budget and just want something better than the previous generation, go for a Wii. It's cheap, the graphics are better, and the remotes are great fun. It has Zelda :) If you have a larger budget and really want the high definition, you're now choosing between the 360 and the PS3. You really do have to look at the specifics of each, and think seriously about your gaming style, to see which matches you best. If I were to make a flip summarization, if you really love online gameplay, I'd go with the XBox 360. Its years of head-start really give it a robust environment here. If you are looking for more of a home-based one-machine media center for your MPs3, photos and huge world gameplay, I'd go with the PS3. It definitely has the advantage on large scale games. Feel free to email me if you have more specific questions, or for screenshots, graphic descriptions, or interface information on any of the three systems.</td><td>Unbiased Review from an Owner of All Three</td><td>1163808000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>46685</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 16, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00009PS22</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Mario Golf Toadstool Tour for the Nintendo GameCube is a fun game that involves a variety of real golf decisions. Wii owners should be pleased to know that it plays well on the Wii as well! The graphics are certainly less sharp than what you get on the Wii, but not horrendously so - it still immerses you fairly promptly into the golf playing fun with a selection of players - Yoshi, Princess Peach, and many others. There are a number of courses to play on, with their own personalities. There are a number of games as well, for from one to four players. If you're playing on a Wii, make sure you buy the special GameCube controllers in order to play. You *cannot* play this with either the Wii controllers or with any of the other controllers that you might get with the system. You can get both wired and wireless versions from most game stores. Also, make sure you get a Nintendo GameCube memory card. There's a spot in the top of the Wii to insert it, to save your games. Back to the game itself. It is a fairly straightforward golf game, in that to swing you hit a button on the back swing, and then again on the forward swing. So it's something even newcomers can get the hang of. Those who are better at golf (or gameplaying for that matter) can tweak the club they use, the exact placement of the club on the ball, and many other details. There are some situations where the lesser graphics of the GameCube become apparent. When you're trying to put on the green the various lines showing you the slopes can be very cluttering on the screen with their blockiness. It can be hard to see exactly where the hole is, amongst everything else. Yes you can temporarily remove all of those lines, but on modern systems you can have both on the display without it being a giant mess. Also, speaking of putting, the precision of button pressing in order to make a perfect put is pretty challenging. You would think Mario Golf would be a game for kids, but I imagine most youngsters would be frustrated by doing such a precise pair of button pressing for the putt activity. Still, there's a great collection of games and tutorials in here, so you can keep replaying and enjoy it each time, especially if you get friends involved. Also, there's a nice feature of being able to save a game part way through, so if you have to take a break for some reason, you can easily come back and start again from that point when you are able to. Well recommended if you're a golfing fan!</td><td>Plays Well on the Wii</td><td>1289865600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>32392</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>11 16, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00005YVTY</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Gauntlet Dark Legacy for the Nintendo GameCube is a great hack-and-slash game that builds on the classic legend. Luckily it can be played well on the Wii! I grew up adoring the Gauntlet series. I poured tons of quarters into the machines. \"Green archer needs food badly\"! When Gauntlet Dark Legacy first came out for the Nintendo GameCube we bought it immediately, and played through it, enjoying it immensely. That was over eight years ago now. I wondered recently just how well this old favorite would hold up to modern standards, and if it would play on the Wii system. To my delight, the game starts up without any issues. Make sure you have a GameCube memory card in your Wii, and a pair of GameCube controllers so that you and a friend can enjoy the fun. Your standard Wii controller won't work with this game. You can then choose from a variety of characters - archers, knights, jesters, and more, all in a selection of colors, and jump into the game! There are a number of different worlds to explore, each with its own theme and enemies. When you're working through a level you track down food and gather up magic, you slaughter the enemies, and then you figure out how to move on to the next area. It's not a game requiring great brainpower - but it is immensely fun nonetheless. You clear out the enemies, race away from the \"death\" character, build up your character level by level. As you win the levels, your skills increase, and as you reach certain plateaus your character's looks change, their visuals of their attacks change, and you unlock new character options as well. The game can be played single player but it really shines in multiplayer, with a pair (or more!) of people hacking away together, one providing remote cover while the other hacks away at the monster. You can even create combo attacks! Yes, the graphics are very blocky. You are not dealing with high quality details on the monsters or terrains. Still, you don't even pay attention to that after the first few minutes. You're just running around, madly hitting the buttons, and killing everything that moves. It's the great sort of game that you can pick up when you're feeling stressed, play for half an hour or ten minutes or four hours, and put it down whenever you need to and feel refreshed! Well recommended. We purchased Gauntlet Dark Legacy with our own money from a gaming store.</td><td>Still Crazy Fun After All These Years</td><td>1289865600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>65167</td><td>4.0</td><td>18</td><td>false</td><td>11 16, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000930DP0</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I love James Bond games. It's really interesting that this latest game release is from a movie of the 60s, with the original great Sean Connery in the main role. The graphics are really gorgeous. If you go running around an old chalet, you have the textured stone walls, reflective mirrors and fine art paintings on the wall. The character movements are quite smooth. Bond can vault over hedges, climb up on walls and perform other moves. Strangely, the camera itself is a bit sub par. The \"field of view\" of your character is very limited - and you can only target enemies that you can see. The audio is great. Sean Connery does the vocals, but of course it's his \"modern\" self so it doesn't quite sound as young as the character in the story. Maybe his voice is raspy from too many martinis :) The traditional Bond music plays in the background, drawing you in to the movie atmosphere. Gameplay in general is traditional Bond fare, which I love. You run around from mission to mission, tracking down bad guys, looking for certain items, and in general finding cool ways in which to kill the enemies. This isn't a slaughter button-mashing game. If you find the most elegant way to handle the situation - the \"Bond\" way - you are rewarded with really amazing scenes. It's well worth it.

As soon as Going Commando game out we grabbed a copy - and have been playing it non-stop ever since! Talk about a great sequel! The plot and gameplay is similar to the first game - you're going from planet to planet, bashing things, gathering up nuts and bolts and finding some INCREDIBLY fun weapons along the way. Even better, if you still have your memory card from the first game, you get to bring in many weapons from that for free. If you didn't play Ratchet & Clank I, I *really* recommend you get it! It should be super-cheap by now and is great fun. It's not required to understand this second game, though. This game is almost like 20 games in one. There are pod-racing like portions where you challenge on faster and faster tracks. There are gladiator arena fighting where you test your strength and endurance. There are spaceship flying sections like Wing Commander where you fly through asteroids and around corners. There are button-combos and logic puzzles and really funny video clips. There are the skill points that you have to guess at and then execute. Each weapon upgrades to a new super version of itself. You really feel like you're making progress as you move through the game, becoming stronger and further along in the plot. Going back to planets is great fun, too, as you find ways to use your new weapons in fun ways. The game is also great on an entire-family sort of way. There's a lot of fun puns that will go right over the heads of the kids, but in general the game can be great fun for everyone. The kids can hand the controller to the adults if they get stuck, and the adults will have just as much fun as the kids did (and may not give the controller back for a while). There's always something fun to do, and if you want a change from what you're doing, just hop into one of the mini-games for a whole different experience. The game can literally go on forever.

You can be Aragorn, Sam, Gandalf or other characters on your quest to save Middle Earth! Made in the same style as Two Towers, the game covers the third movie complete with video clips from the movie, actor interviews, voice-overs by the original actors and much more. Gandalf's actor, for example, jokes that the wizard in the game seems to be far more agile than the wizard in the movie was :) The gameplay is very similar to Two Towers and apparently they made many improvements based on user feedback. For example, when you do character upgrades, you can choose just to upgrade the character you are currently playing with (say Faramir) or to upgrade ALL characters for that ability. That makes the upgrade paths VERY interesting. There are three main event paths. There is the way of the Wizard, where Gandalf takes on the Gondor defenses. There's the way of the King, where Aragorn builds up his army. Then there's the way of the Hobbit, where poor Sam and Frodo struggle their ways into the depths of Moria. It's a great preview of the movie, showing lots of film clips of the various battles and scenes. There are many very slick changes between video and gameplay that really make you feel involved. The character movement is great, between the combo attacks and killing blows. It's not just a hack and slash, there's a fair amount of strategy involved, both in in-game handling of the enemies as well as how to upgrade to get all characters to the end point. And once you reach the end - the game isn't over. There are characters to unlock, and special skills to earn for each one. You go back through the various levels with each character, trying to get even higher scores and build up your characters. Co-op mode adds to the fun - pair up Aragorn with Gandalf and wade your way through massive piles of orcs. If you want to see something truly impressive, wait until you get to the final battle at the black gate and SWARMS of orcs, each an individual AI person with its own direction and attitude - are seething around you. Now THAT is impressive. The sounds are amazing, the blasts of smoke, fire and thunder surrounding you truly give you the sense of battle shock. The game plays fast and can be replayed indefinitely.

This is a showcase for the great achievements gaming has made. Other time-involve games either jumped years forward or back in time, or used cheezy VCR symbols to handle your time changes. In Sands of Time, it's extremely easy to use and VERY handy. You fall off a ledge? Just slide back in time a bit and try again! The graphics are just amazing. The character moves fluidly, and the combat sequences look like a well animated movie. The character can run along walls, do back flips, climb poles, leap chasms, and much more. When he runs along a wall and passes a banner, the banner ripples in the wind. The attention to detail - from shadows to textures to torches flickering and water rippling - is just amazing. Part of the game is slaying your enemies in new and interesting ways. But part is negotiating the terrain and figuring out how to get to the next area. Some of the puzzles are straightforward - run along the wall, jump up the ledges. But others are far more devious and require a lot of thought to get through. There are many great releases out right now that we are enjoying greatly, but Sands of Time is the one that always draws the most fascinated reactions from friends. They comment constantly on the graphics, animation and gameplay while we move from scene to scene. It's like poetry in motion. And it's fun.

In Summoner 2 you are the Queen of Halassar - and you're on a mission! The game is an RPG and is very Final Fantasy-like. You have a group of people in your party, going around talking to everyone you meet, taking on quests, learning lore about your land. The things you do affect what they say and move the plot along. The graphics are a bit blocky, with repetitive textures and not-quite-smooth objects. The sounds are reasonably OK. You buy things from shop, gather up needed items, and your Queen's special power is that she can turn into various summons as needed. With all the really great RPGs out, I think there just wasn't quite anything in Summoner 2 that stood out as super. The graphics were OK. The sounds were OK. The plot line was OK. The combat system gets a bit tedious after a while. If you've already played the recent Final Fantasy games, and Elder Scrolls Morrowind and NeverWinter Nights, then you might fall back to this game. But there are definitely better RPGs out on the market right now that are amazingly fun to play for months and months.

It's not Rome this time, but a fantasy planet with good and evil. I had originally played the Demo of Gladius on XBox and wasn't very impressed. Luckily they did make some solid changes to the game by release time to add to the interest factor. There's a basic story of good and evil, with the Queen of the Valkries giving her life to slay the demon of chaos. There are also two human tribes, in essence the Vikings vs the Romans. When you begin the game you can choose to be a Viking woman or a Roman man, both strong, young warriors. You work your way up through gladiator combat, which is the 'peaceful' way that the two tribes work out their aggressions now. You earn certificates in various areas to allow you to fight, and move through various stages of arena level. You build up your skills, gain team members, and learn more about the plot and the underlying good-evil conflict as you go. The graphics are reasonably good, and I have to say, I'm actually impressed with the plot. It's not just \"filler\" for button-mashing combat. It really does give you a sense that these characters have dreams and worries, that they have friendships and that things affect them. The characterizations and voices were well done. There is in-arena combat which is just fought until there is a winner, and out-of-arena combat where the fights are to the death. The locations do feel different from each other, and you get a sense of wanting to gain more reputation and explore your options. I'm much more a real-time combat person myself - I love Dynasty Warriors 4 and Return of the King, for example. I felt sort of stifled by the turn based system, having to stop and wait for my turn to move on the grid and attack. But really, I love the Final Fantasy games and those are turn based. So it's something about the moving and fighting combos that just wasn't my style. People who are more into turn based will really love this game. Highly recommended for turn based fans looking for a quality game!</td><td>Great turn based combat with a plot too!</td><td>1068940800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>43219</td><td>5.0</td><td>40</td><td>false</td><td>11 16, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00008G7MM</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>RPG Maker 2 for the PS2 brings 3D adventure creation to the consoles. A great improvement over RPG Maker, the depth of games you can create with this is staggering. First, if you haven't tried RPG Maker, the original, that is a simple 2-D adventure maker that could make games such as Final Fantasy 1 and 2. You had little 'wizards' and 'warriors' and such moving up, down, left and right through towns, dungeons, castles and forests. You could have simple dialogue, music and events. This might be a good starting system for someone very new to game creation, to help them learn in a very simple manner. RPG Maker 2 launches into full 3 dimensional adventures, so you have to be able to think more seriously about the layout of your games. Instead of just having a \"flat world\" that you move through, you literally take blocks and create a 3D world, with stairs up to higher levels, hidden rooms, and much more. You can change the texture of every block, making giant cathedrals, small village huts, wooden bridges, and just about anything you can imagine. You can connect a USB keyboard to type in long descriptions, and your choices of graphics, sounds and events are much more intense. As you might imagine, you can therefore take MONTHS and months to create huge adventure worlds. The tools are all there, but it takes a little while to get used to how they work, as with any new design system. When your game is done, save it onto a memory card and trade it off to friends. This could be the perfect way to learn about game design and create something that others are willing to pay to play! Highly recommended for aspiring game designers who are good with logic and complex design. I'd still recommend the original RPG Maker for younger kids who need to learn the 2D basics first.</td><td>Great Way to Learn How to Create Games</td><td>1068940800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>36146</td><td>4.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>11 16, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006AALC</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Syberia is a puzzle-adventure where a young female lawyer figures out different mechanical puzzles to get through gorgeously detailed worlds. What really shines in this game are the graphics. They are beautifully rendered, and each world has its own unique look. The woods and metals, water and plants are all very realistic. On the downside, in an era where you can look at whatever you want, and the world seems \"alive\", this is more like walking through a beautiful, yet static painting. Every \"area\" has only one angle. You can't rotate at all to look behind things. If the angle they present is difficult for you to work with, too bad. You're stuck. And while in a few areas the water ripples, for the most part it is simply flat. The trees' leaves don't rustle, the clouds don't float across the sky. A few years ago this would have been fine, but in most games today you get that level of immersion. So I did miss that. The game is all about puzzle solving. A young female lawyer intrigued me as the heroine of the story. This should mean she's smart! Plus she's not \"overbuilt\" as (ahem) certain other female main characters are. She's a bit on the anorexic side, but generally reasonable. However, one has to doubt her smartness! She's a lawyer, so supposedly trained for years and years in logical thinking. Yet when her boss calls her to get a status update, she goes, \"Duh, I don't know! Where am I going? I'm really not sure\" when everyone playing the game knows clearly what her destination is from the material she's read. Instead of talking reasonably with her fiance Dan, she acts like his doormat, and worries that he won't like her being such an 'explorer' (i.e. walking along a river). Her comment when she sees a wet oar? \"Oooooh yucchy, I have to get someone to fetch it for me because *I* won't touch something that icky\". Her talks with her best friend are shopping-raves about Bloomingdale's. So they start with this character that SHOULD be a great one, and promptly turn her into a dirt-fearing shop-hound airhead girly-girl. Ah well. The sound is nice if a bit repetitive, and the dialogues are very repetitive. I tended to hop through most of them while playing, just reading the words. There was a LOT of back-and-forth-and-back-and-forth mindless shuttle missions, where you talked to X, who said to talk to Y, who then said to talk to X, who then said to talk to Z. What made it even worse is that I easily played the first half of the game one evening and was planning on saving at the end of the second \"area\" (there are only 4). Instead, the game crashed on me! So now I had to go back through those entire inane walking puzzles which required no thought at all but lots of clicking. In general the puzzles weren't very difficult at all. The objects you found were obvious, and in some cases even where there *might* have been some thought involved, they shoehorned you into doing it a certain way. Many of them were random. You find four cards for an organ. Just randomly stick them in until one works, and the rest instantly vanish. If you did that one first, you would never have gotten to hear the other songs. Still, the gorgeous painting-graphics are lovely, and it's always refreshing to see a female lead character, even if she is a bit of an air-head. The ending is very disappointing, though, and you can win the game in about 8 hours. Hopefully a sequel will come out with the character a bit more mature, and with a world which is more interactive. Until then, I'll pass the CDs along to friends, to let them give it a try!</td><td>Short gameplay and pretty easy puzzles</td><td>1037404800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>43819</td><td>5.0</td><td>211</td><td>false</td><td>11 15, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00008J7NZ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I just finished the full walkthrough for Halo 2, as well as played a number of multiplayer games. I'm finally ready with the review of this awesome game! First off, this is obviously the sequel to the hugely popular initial Halo game. You are Master Chief, a space marine who is sent out to battle the enemies. You are fighting the Covenant, who are your main foes, but you also run into the Flood, who are a space parasite that wants to eat all life. In addition, there are mechanical creatures on Halo who want to kill pretty much anything including the Flood. So each location and creature type has its own look, feel, attitudes and reactions. The graphics are simply gorgeous, from the rippling water to the clouds in the sky and reflections off of surfaces. I love taking screenshots of this game. The music is also extremely well done, in that the quality is always very high. But it's a little bizarre to be going from new age lilting softness in one heated battle to high intensity rock music in another and so on. It doesn't necessary track to the location you're in, either. It's just whatever the designers felt like putting in. The gameplay and plot is where this game really shines. Your characters that interact with you are simply BRILLIANT in how they each do what a real live creature would do. Grunts are my favorite - these little Covenant front-liners are brave and talkative when they're in groups, but when you whittle them down they suddenly turn and flee, shrieking at the top of their lungs. Your teammates leap into vehicles with you, either driving or shooting depending on your preference. They'll come alongside you to give you support, and duck for cover when appropriate. The quips the characters come out with mid-battle still make me laugh out loud. In one sequence you are the covenant Arbitor and are working your way through a room. You come across a pair of grunts and a jackal under attack, and take out the enemies. The grunt comes running to you in glee, shouting, \"Arbitor! My savior!\" Then he pauses and adds, \"Jackal, say thank you to the Arbitor!\" :) The cut scenes are equally as brilliant and are truly movie quality in the interactions. The timing, dialogue, everything is great. The little touches are everywhere. In one sequence, the Sergeant is preparing his troops to get ejected in pods down to the surface of Halo. He walks past the Master Chief's pod and thumps twice on it, as if to say \"All OK in there, ready to go?\" Right on beat, you see Master Chief inside his pod, thumping once back in response. You really forget that these are just computer generated characters. Multiplayer is the stellar addition to this release and there are reasons to be thrilled. You can play on a large variety of maps, in a number of styles, and there is even going to be downloadable content in the future. That all being said, there are of course a few non-stellar aspects to this release. First, the ending SUCKS. The first one was bad enough with its \"Oh I bet there is another Halo out there\" so you don't even feel like you really saved the world. In this one, not only is it not a \"you're done but it's not over\" ending - it's pretty much cut off mid-battle! That is INCREDIBLY frustrating for a gameplayer. Obviously they want you to buy Halo 3, but that's going to be a year or two away. Can't we have some satisfaction in the meantime? Next, the game is really short, even on normal mode. We had a friend start the game up Sunday morning at about 12:30 and he was done with the entire game by around 8. You can have fun replaying it on the harder levels, but that's a rather quick game. Finally, the multiplayer, while brilliant in concept, is lacking in implementation right now. There are two general ways to play - either you set up a game yourself for friends ONLY, or you launch into the ether to play a quick match. If you get up your own game you can control all the settings, but you can only invites people on your friends list. That limits the chances of having a full game unless you are VERY proactive in seeking friends. The quick match game only lets you make a few choices, and then in essence you are auto-connected with other people who are also actively seeking those game types. You can't browse or look. You just say \"I want to play X type of game\" and then you wait - literally for 5 minutes or more sometimes - as the servers gather together other people who are also actively seeking that game type. Then the game auto launches without you even knowing who is on your team or if you want to play with them. It's very frustrating to people who are used to the more customizeable lobby situations. Still, the online experience can always be tweaked going forward, and the base gameplay is amazingly good. I highly recommend the game to anyone who enjoys shooting / strategy games - but you might want to rent it for a week first, to see if what it offers to you after that point is going to keep you playing.</td><td>Brilliant sequel with only a few flaws</td><td>1100476800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>90891</td><td>5.0</td><td>54</td><td>false</td><td>11 14, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000HE9LL8</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Elite Beat Agents is one of those games that seems awfully silly - but is incredibly addictive once you get started. It's a rhythm game with some fun songs to play along with. The plot is the silly part. Secret agents watch for trouble - babysitters trying to calm down kids, little girls missing their daddies - and jump in to help out. The way they help is by dancing along to the music.  This is like finding a \"plot\" for tetris. Just ignore it :) The real fun is the actual gameplay. You have a song playing in the background - the 19 different tracks include songs like YMCA, Material Girl, You're the Inspiration, La La, Sk8ter Boi, Let's Dance and much more. There's a good mix to please most players. Now you tap along with the song on circles on the screen. Let's say you're playing Material Girl. They might show 4 circles in a row for you to tap along with the song. A larger circle will show around each circle, closing in on it and matching it right when you're supposed to tap it. Sometimes you slide along a line. Sometimes you double tap. The taps make drum beats and cymbals, so it really does sound like you're playing along with the song. The \"closing circles\" are really easy to see and understand and draw your eyes along. In between verses, the top screen shows you manga-like scenes of the \"story\" you are following. So in one story, a weathergirl is trying to get rainy clouds to go away so she can have a picnic with her son. The scenes show her getting help from people in blowing away the clouds. Depending on how well you do in your playing, you get different endings - so you really have incentive to do your best and to replay. There are two levels of difficulty, and on each level you get a rating of how well you did. You can easily go back and replay levels to get the highest rating in each one. You might think that 19 songs aren't a lot, but really, you don't play a song just once. That would be like listening to a song just once on the radio or on your MP3 player! You listen to and play them repeatedly because it's fun to hear the song and fun to play along.

In essence this is an action-RPG with you moving from mission to mission, learning more as you go, gaining skills and new weapons. Most missions involve shooting down waves of bad guys with your rifle or revolvers. There are numerous side missions, from pony-express relays to poker playing and tracking down wanted men. The game is pretty typical of its genre. Pony express missions involve \"go here! No, go there! Wait, go to a third spot!\" within a time limit. Hunt-and-find missions abound. The plot is also pretty standard. You start with Colton and his \"dad\" out tracking some game. \"Dad won't last more than one mission,\" says I. Sure enough, in the very next area he's slain. Life was cheap in the Old West. The graphics are sort of a mixed bag. On one hand they don't look \"stunning\" in some parts, at least as high-quality as you've come to expect from recent XBox releases. On the other hand, sometimes when you're riding your horse across the desert and the sun is setting behind rock formations, it is simply *gorgeous*. I also have to comment that the horse movements are really nicely done. The way the horse's muscles move and the various gaits are right on. The sound is reasonable. The voice acting isn't bad, and beyond that you just get the shot noises from the various guns. It's not in your face, but really it doesn't need to be. Being in the west was about being in a vast landscape with silence around you. There were a few glitches with the game. If bad guys were up on the second floor of a building, you could often see their shadows *through the floor* to know where they were. Also, the red dots on the mini-map to point out enemies was nice, but it also gave you a sort of xray vision to pinpoint their locations even if you couldn't visually see them. I know this is a mature title, but I found the excess of blood spurting and obscene language to be a bit much. This was the Old West, and yes, there was blood. It doesn't need to rain across the entire screen. Yes, they were cussers. But the language they used back then would have been different than some of what they say in the game. I'd much rather have had authentic badmouthing than to have them use some of the nasty phrases the game features. That all being said, I did have a lot of fun playing this, even if at times it felt a bit like I was Link riding all over Hyrule doing my various quests.

Games that encouraged you to run mindlessly around, shooting other people, didn't seem to have much value. That was until I played CounterStrike, though. I've always been a HUGE fan of strategy. Games that encouraged you to think, to plan ahead and to execute the plan as a team, really thrilled me. When I saw my first games of Counterstrike, it was like watching Band of Brothers on HBO. One unit worked together to the left, while another coordinated on the right. Each followed the plan closely to capture the flag. Yes, you knocked out the enemy. But it was in the persuit of a goal, to achieve an objective. It was AMAZINGLY fun! Some people might object that it's bloody, that it promotes people killing people. If you're going to worry about games that have winners and losers, then any game of tag, or dodge-ball or 'cowboys and indians' is going to fall victim. Here, people who are shot respawn so they can regroup with their team. The victory goes to the smartest team with the best plan - the team that works well together and defends each other. I don't know of a better objective for a game. Best of all, being a net game, this can easily be played as a family. Your uncle in Texas, your aunt in Mississippi, and your cousin in California can join into the game, all playing vital roles regardless of their location, age, sex, color, or anything else. I highly recommend this as a game for anyone over 12, and I'd encourage you to get a few copies to give to other friends and family members.

The majority find it spellbindingly beautiful, a work of poetry, and well deserving of the 1975 Pulitzer Prize it was awarded. A small, vocal group insist it's mind-numbingly dull, with no plot and no resolution. It doesn't go anywhere. In many ways I find that the story, and readers' reactions, are quite similar to how meditation is perceived. First, the basics. Annie Dillard married a poet, earned a Master's Degree in English, and wrote her thesis on Thoreau and Walden Pond. For two years after she graduated she was writing, journaling, and painting. She then decided that in essence she should write her own take on nature, similar to Thoreau's experiences. Where Thoreau was a man out in rural Massachusetts in the mid-1800s, Dillard was a woman, over a hundred years later, in rural Roanoke, Virginia. She felt there was room enough in the world for a fresh take on natural life. And indeed she was quite correct. This isn't a story about a person starting Here and ending up There. It isn't even a series of essays, as some readers have mistakenly assumed. Instead, Dillard is clear that this is a cohesive piece, organized chronologically, building and expanding on previous experiences and then moving forward. Dillard is not only keen in her insight into what is before her, but also amazingly well read. She can find the relations between the water before her and the Eskimo traditions, between a barely visible creature and the quotes of scientists from decades ago. It's like sitting down at the side of a pond with your beloved aunt who has traveled the world, and hearing fascinating stories about how various bits of life relate to fascinating creatures far away. The book is poetry, and one focus here is that *life* is poetry. Everything around us is beautiful and terrible and will be gone in the blink of an eye. Turn your head too quickly and it will skitter off, never to be seen again. The roiling crimson beauty of a magnificent sunset will fade into a smoky grey, and no matter how many sunsets you watch after that, none will ever be quite the same. Is it boring to read about the fantastic myriad wonders that nature presents to us every day? That's an intriguing question. Somehow our world has trained us to be obsessively attentive when a movie-screen freight train barrels towards a stalled car, but to turn away uninterested when a double rainbow shimmers into existence over a lake. We stare down at our smartphone screen in dedicated frenzy when a Facebook post blings into existence, but we ignore the real live human being before us who we could learn so much from. We want a start, a middle, and an end. But nature goes on, always renewing, constantly restoring, and I think somewhere many of us have lost track of that. So, yes, settling in with Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is like settling into a favorite chair on your back porch, sipping a delicious glass of wine, and watching with fascination as the golden-winged dragonflies perform an intricate mating ritual. It is spellbinding, and soothing, and fascinating - but one has to want to slow down and pay attention. One needs to mute the TV, turn off the cell, and be willing to breathe in the natural world which is all around us.

You get a physical \"guitar\" controller with this game, and it's amazingly fun! You hold the controller just like a real guitar, and it's switchable for left handed players. The neck of the guitar has 5 buttons on it that you play with your left hand. In the center of the guitar is a \"strum\" button that you hit to play the notes. There's even a metal bar to wiggle, to cause the notes to \"bend\" to give an extra crowd boost. If you're not a big hard rock / metal fan, there's only a few songs to choose from. You get Ziggy Stardust, Crossroads, Killer Queen, Sharp Dressed Man, More than a Feeling and a few more. Those who like harder rock will be quite thrilled, though. There's Iron Man, I Wanna Be Sedated, Symphony of Destruction, You've Got Another Thing Comin' and much more. There are four difficulty levels. You start with easy of course, where it's great fun to play along with your favorite songs and just have fun. When you crank up to the higher levels - moving through various venues and unlocking different characters and guitars - the keys get VERY difficult. Still, it's a blast hammering away at the notes, waving your guitar around in the air and having fun. The sound is quite good, and you get a real boost from hearing the crowd cheer and yell for you. The visuals are reasonable - but really, this isn't a game about visuals. You just watch for the buttons to press, and press them. It's really about the music.

I suppose that new games will come out soon with more song options, which I'll look forward to. Next is the key layout. I really love the strum bar. But the buttons up on the neck of the guitar are AWFUL. They have 5 wide buttons all in a straight line. The buttons have to be pressed straight in to work well. Human fingers simply don't work that way. They should have put the buttons at an angle - both angled a bit diagonally the way a hand holds a guitar neck, and also angled up-down so that your fingers press into them at an angle. As it is now, the buttons tend to stick and jam. When you fail at a really complex song because the keys have stuck, it's very frustrating. That being said, you can usually get through an hour or two before your fingers really start to kill you. If you play with a group of friends, passing the guitar around between songs, that means an afternoon can go by before all of you end up with finger pain.

Still, this game is quite fun to play and features newly re-mixed video. The Wachowski Brothers personally worked on this game, and recombined video segments from the movies to build new sequences for the game. It really helps to have seen the movies, because while the game does move along with a plot, the montages of video clips would probably be very confusing if you didn't have the basic idea of what was going on. So what IS going on. You're Neo, and you are given the choice of a red pill or blue pill. Amusingly, if you take the blue pill, you're sent back through your alarm clock and wake up as if out of a dream. Take the red pill, and you start on your path to Being the One. First it's a tutorial-like step by step guide to escaping the office building, with a far more convoluted path than seen in the movie. Soon you're in a training arena, poking fun at a variety of video games. Then you move along through the storyline, with a wide variety of focus abilities and world-changing powers. The graphics are reasonably good. At this point in time you really don't look to a PS2 for cutting edge graphics - the XBox has such amazing titles out, and the XBox 360 is just SO sweet, that you accept what you get from the PS2. That being said, I really found the movements of the characters to be quite impressive. Some of the martial arts moves were very smooth and realistic looking. The sound is OK for an adventure game. Some of the little audio snippets get annoying VERY quickly, but that's the way it goes. The music in general was in the Matrix theme and helped you feel like you were a part of the movie. If you're a fan of the trilogy, then it's great to get back into that world and to be able to choose your own path - and find a new ending - to the storyline in a way endorsed and written by the creators. You can replay the game a few times, on increasing levels of difficulty, to extend your gameplay enjoyment. That being said, this is a lot shorter start-to-end then most games I own, which is a bit frustrating. Well recommended for Matrix fans.</td><td>A Great Visit to the Matrix World</td><td>1131840000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>259409</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>11 12, 2011</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B005WXIO44</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The successor to the famed castle-building series, \"Stronghold 3\" modernizes the graphics of the first game and...not much else. \"Stronghold 3\" is the newest game in the Stronghold series, which is about building castles, establishing economies, surviving sieges, and so on. Stronghold 1, released in 2001, was a smash hit despite its limited gameplay options, and while Stronghold 2 was less well-received it was still acceptable. Stronghold 3, unfortunately, has decided to take no risks and copy Stronghold 1 wholesale, without introducing any new features (and losing some of the features introduced in Stronghold 2). When I say that Stronghold 3 is exactly like Stronghold 1, I know what I'm talking about: the game, on Steam, came bundled with Stronghold 1 if you pre-ordered the game. So I was able to play Stronghold 1, quit, load up Stronghold 3, and see that it was literally the same without adding any new features apart from graphics. The relatively uninformative HUD and limited building selection was acceptable in 2001 as a limitation of technology, but ten years later it's pointlessly useless. The game is in essence about collecting resources, whether it's for food, building materials, or weapon-making. There's no information about how fast you're gathering resources, expected harvest levels, or anything of that nature. You can check your current stockpiles, and you can be told that \"more people means faster food depletion\" but you can never see how much food is needed. This is especially annoying when you have crops like wheat which need to be ground up at a mill and then converted to bread at a bakery; the only way you can tell if the system is jammed up is by periodically comparing how much wheat, flour, and bread you have. The combat system isn't much better; unit AI is pathetic, and things like walls have no defensive value whatsoever. The game modes are laughably underdeveloped. There's a campaign mode (which tells a story using not cutscenes, but black-and-white sketches), a free build mode (with exactly two maps, both of which are tiny), and a \"historical siege\" mode (where the castles are tiny and most definitely NOT built to historically accurate levels). There's not really enough room just to build a castle for the sake of building a castle, as all the maps are cramped and confined. The one real appeal of the game - the opportunity to build in 3d, as opposed to Stronghold 1's 2d - isn't brought into play because the maps are just too small. The graphics, while an improvement over Stronghold 1, are barely acceptable for 2011 standards. There's not a lot of customization options and building types, so your castle is always going to look like a random mishmash of structures with a wall around it rather than something actually aesthetically pleasing. The opportunity to build a castle is the only reason that the game would be worth playing, and it's not even really good at that. Overall, Stronghold 3 is a shameful disappointment on every level; even people who absolutely loved Stronghold 1 are better off playing that game than shelling out $50 for this.

You switch between the characters of Billy - the young half-Mexican lad, and Ray, his uncle, a gunslinger who is out to kill him. The conflict is that Billy, coming home after several years of roaming, finds his mother and abusive stepfather are dead. Ray thinks Billy has done the deed.  The story then plays out with Billy trying to clear his name and find a fortune, and Ray wanting revenge. The story is extremely linear, as you might expect in this situation. If you're hopping between the two characters and, as Ray, you were able to Kill Bill, the game would be over.  I definitely understand the linear gameplay. Heck, in pretty much any game you want to achieve their end objective, be it  take over the town or destroy all the enemies. Still, it's nice to feel you have some control along the way. Entire roads are blocked because of a plot twist?? Also, as much as it is linear, it is very vague. You're told to do something, but then you have to stumble around for a while to figure out what exactly they want you to do in order to progress. It can get frustrating. The graphics aren't that bad on a high def TV - the individual leaves on the trees are visible and the humans are reasonably detailed. We've taken several trips to the western US region and it really is pretty out there. They did a nice job on some of the cut scenes, with small reflections in metal surfaces, the dull rasp of leather, and other details. The clouds aren't solid objects that drift - they actually change shape as they go. The voice work in the game is reasonable enough, but while I liked the soundtrack at the beginning, it got really repetitive REALLY quickly. In some games the soundtrack blends in really nicely and you enjoy it. That's not the case here. It's a shame too, because sometimes it's peaceful as you walk along beneath the drifting clouds, with the grasses slowly waving, the birds singing in the trees. As much as I appreciate the differences of sneaky Billy with his whip vs shooting Ray with his guns, I just didn't like this game as much as some of the other westerns we own. It was too linear, the soundtrack was too maddening, and it was too short. A great game to rent for a week, and that way you can see if you adore it enough to keep it after that.</td><td>Short, Repetitive, but Relatively Fun</td><td>1193875200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>308523</td><td>5.0</td><td>7</td><td>false</td><td>10 9, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>0007461100</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Fleetwood Mac was a band that got a great deal of attention in the 70s and 80s. Rumors had at least song from each band member! Right from the start, you get the sense that this album is about love lost, love regained, and the pain in between. Secondhand News is a boppy song that had a guy pleading for his girl to take him back, even if it's only for an occasional roll in the hay. Dreams has Stevie singing about the ups and downs of love - when the rain washes you clean, you'll know. Never Going Back Again has guitar work that I really enjoy, and again its happy, upbeat tune seems to try to add a happy face to what is in essence a very sad song - Been down one time, been down two times - never going back again. The next song, Don't Stop is more upbeat, and tries to say that tomorrow will be better. You Can Go Your Own Way is a sad song of breaking up, but again looks at the bright side. It's just the way it is, and life has to go on. But if I had to choose a real favorite here, it is Songbird. When I was growing up, this was very meaningful - it really seemed to say that no matter what the troubles, you could look for that silver lining. I could go on and on. Each song has its own poignant message. Yes, you can call them easy-California-pop ... but these songs weren't invented by some sort of a recording studio. This band was really going through the traumas involved. If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me, they sing in Oh, Daddy - and they mean it.

You use your Wii motion controllers to stitch up wounds, roll on bandages, and zap tumors. This is a sequel, so the game expects that you already know the characters and the background story. They talk about healing powers and other events with the assumption that you know what they mean. You can take two approaches here. First, you can of course go back and play the first game or at least read its plot online. Second, you can completely ignore the whole plot. Much of it borders on silly anyway. The game uses stationary backgrounds with a drawing of the person who is talking, and you have to step through their dialogues frame by frame before you get to the actual gameplay. There's no way to skip it besides pressing A-A-A-A to skip each line of dialogue. It's even a little more silly because the person talking is always \"standing\" in front of you, even if - plot-wise - they are supposed to be laying, crushed, beneath a collapsed building. Once you get through the dialogue of a given situation, you then get into the actual gameplay. You have a time limit to fix whatever is wrong with the person. Surprises often spring up while you're operating on the person. Suddenly there are more tumors, or more shards of glass appear. It keeps you on your toes. The person's vitals are dropping, the clock is ticking, and blood starts oozing. It tests your ability to work under pressure. Some of the things you do are at reasonably accurate. When you open someone up, you slice them with a scalpel. When you stitch up a wound, you zig-zag with sutures. Other aspects are just silly. So you need to look at this as \"medical lite\" - giving you some basic fun of playing at being a doctor, but not teaching you much real knowledge. This holds true, too, for the dialogue. They often throw in words that have medical meaning, but because they don't explain any of it or the context, it becomes a meaningless babble. If you're used to playing games where you just zip through them, then even on easy mode this one might provide a fair amount of challenge for you. They expect you to be quick and accurate with your movements. They're a little extreme if you fail on a level - rather than a gentle \"try again\" you get a stomping - \"you failed completely! You give up completely on being a doctor and wallow in grief for the rest of your life!\" If you find the game challenging, though, there's a fun multi-player option here! One person can be ready with the healing potions, while the other person busily drains and sutures and bandages the wounds.  The game becomes immensely fun if you have two people playing. Well recommended, but do be aware of its difficulty level. If you're getting this for a younger teen (one who doesn't mind slicing open bodies and draining blood out of wounds of course) you might need to either join in on levels yourself or enlist a friend to help out.

The premise is quite interesting. You're a 34 year old senior female military person, working for the Crayven Corporation. The Order is your enemy, and you fight them. That's about all you know as you begin the game. You fight them because you're told to by the cold manager, Enrica Hayes who has no brains and couldn't care why you do what you do. When you get your mission briefings from Enrica, you then get to configure your units with whatever options are available, fill your drop ships, and land to attack. The game works with individuals grouped together into set units. While a set of 4 tanks move together, a particular tank can get wounded and die. You can't tell a particular tank to go somewhere on its own, though. The unit moves together. This makes it easier to manage many missions, simply grabbing units and pointing them in directions. The graphics are great!  Ground Control has the move-anywhere view that Dark Reign 2 uses. Very intuitive and easy to use. Follow along with a unit, or get a birds-eye view of the great graphical combats. While my Athlon-750 often choked on some of the larger scale combats (boding poor results for slower machines), in general it whisked along at a good clip. The landscape is fully three dimensional and fully rendered. Hide in the shadow of a cliff to get an ambush jump on your enemy. Sneak along under trees or overhangings to avoid being seen. Troops have options for weaponry and healing that can be customized. Troops can be carried in APCs to zip from location to location, and peel out quickly into whichever formation you specify. The downsides on the game are the stuttering I mentioned before on heavy-graphic situations, and also the general situation you, Major Sarah Parker, find yourself in. While it's great that the lead player and her boss are both women, it's very, very annoying playing a game in which you watch your 'friends' shoot up hospitals, where you're berated by your commander and where no matter how quickly you get to someone, the program insists it's \"too late\" and you must watch the person die to further the plot. I have enough frustration in real life without playing a game in which the lead character is drinking after each mission, wondering why she even keeps fighting. Does that provide any incentive for the player to want to keep playing? Also, most games of this style allow the player to choose amongst factions and decide which side to play. In this game it's very linear. Each mission is forced on you, and what you do in the mission is pre-set. While replaying the same mission 10 times might have them decide to attack from the NE or the SE randomly, they always attack, and then the same exact messages always appear, which you cannot click through. If you enjoy strategy combat without building units or structures, and have a fast enough machine to handle this, Ground Control might be the perfect game for you!</td><td>Amazing graphics but your system has to handle it</td><td>970963200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>125219</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>10 6, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000ZK9QD2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The prototypical third-person cover shooter, \"Gears of War 2\" is a solid rush of now-standard gameplay conventions and action movie dialogue. It has its charms, and is a pretty solid game, but isn't without its problems. GoW2 operates under the same basic principles as the first game: you play as a bulky space marine, using cover-shooter mechanics to carve through waves of enemy monsters. Most shooting is either done \"blind\" (shooting from behind cover) or popping out and shooting. Like in the first game, there are a few things that separate it from other cover shooters. The first of these is the \"active reload\" system, where timing your reload properly allows you to do it faster or even improve the damage of your next magazine. The second is melee combat, most famously the \"chainsaw bayonets\" mounted on the standard assault rifle. However, for the most part GoW2's combat is formulaic, like the first. There are a few new weapons to spice things up, though. These include a gatling gun (that must be mounted on cover and cranked to fire) and a mortar launcher (good at distances, but less so at close range). The action is intense and fast-paced, but the main issue is that even with varying weapons, you're still basically doing the same cover routine over and over and over. There are a few sequences to break up the monotony, but they don't disguise the fact that the main game is kind of simplistic. Multiplayer is one of the game's strongest points. There are basically three kinds: cooperative, competitive, and horde mode. Cooperative refers to the ability to play through the campaign with multiple players. It's simplistic, but fun. Competitive refers to the standard set of multiplayer modes - deathmatch, capture-the-flag, etc. Horde mode is an expansion of cooperative mode that allows up to five players to try to survive against waves of enemies. It's probably the most interesting mode, and allows for the most strategic options (figuring out where to hole up, setting traps and killzones, etc). The game's production values are good. It's visually exciting, if a bit repetitive. The guns sound neat, and there's certainly nothing more ominous than the revving of the aforementioned chainsaw-bayonets. Gears of War 2 is most fun as a multiplayer game - it's the kind of game where you can get some friends together and play all afternoon. As mentioned, it gets kind of repetitive, but the multiplayer experience is enough to overcome that. Rating: 8/10.

You play a photojournalists trapped for 3 days in a suburban mall full of zombies. This game is a mixed blessing. Let's start with all the good aspects. The game is FUN. We've all seen the movies with zombies staggering around, and we've all hung out in malls, feeling bored. Put the two together, and voila! You can walk into any store and grab things to bash the zombies with. Run them over with a lawnmower! Pick up a piece of wood and start swinging! Or, my personal favorite, grab an electric guitar at the music store, whip it around like a fast-moving samurai sword, and hear the TWANG when you make contact! The food system actually makes sense here. You go into food court shops! If you find the food in its base form, it's mildly healthy. If you take the time to cook it, it's even better for you. There's an interesting plot to go with it too. I love that the various humans have names and that you actually learn about them, see their interactions and connect with them. You really care (or at least I do!) when you screw up and they get killed. It gives you a lot of incentive to replay the game to try to get everybody out. If you save a husband and his wife, they have a joyful reunion! It really draws you into the game. So there is definitely a lot going for this game. However, there are a few signs that the game could have used a few more months in testing before it was released. First, we have a large high def TV, so we don't have a problem \"seeing things\". However, I've heard from many of my site visitors that on smaller TVs it's nearly impossible to read words or to understand the text messages. That's just unfair. They should have made the game easily playable even on non-high-def or smaller TVs. Plus, why have to read dialogue at all in a horror game? That really interferes with the immersive quality. If you're knee deep in zombie fighting, you don't want to have to puzzle out what a victim is saying to you. They should just yell it out to you in real time so you can keep swinging while you listen. The real killer here, though, is the loading screen. You take 5 steps. LOADING. You turn around. LOADING. You go up the stairs. LOADING. Good God!! With all the other HUGE map games out on the market that load seamlessly, there is no reason that a mall-based game could not do the same. It might have taken a month of coding time to work that in but it would have been WELL worth it. Also, the save system is questionable. Only one save? One save at all? What if a friend comes over and wants to play forward for the weekend, but you want to be able to have your save spot for your own play after he leaves? You can't? Having just one save spot, in a world with a massive hard drive of storage, is nonsensical. Still, you can deal with those issues, and the game really is a lot of fun. Remember though that it is a MATURE game with zombies with exploding heads and a lot of gore. So if you're a mature gamer who enjoys horror, definitely pick this one up!</td><td>Great Horror Fun for a Mature Gamer</td><td>1160092800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>46073</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 4, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00009IM2C</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>It's amazing that Madden NFL is in its 14th year of release!! The graphics and gameplay are almost photo-realistic at this point, and you can control EVERYTHING. First, of course, the graphics. We play this on a 36\" TV and even on the big screen the graphics are incredibly sharp. The characters are realistic down to their hair styles and tattoos. The fields each have their own configurations - including the baseball diamonds on some. The lighting, player moves, reflections and more are incredible. You easily get the sense that you're playing a real game and controlling it. The gameplay builds each year on what came before. So you can create your own team, go through the draft, play it through a season, and get the full satisfaction of getting through the superbowl (if you're good enough). You get to make decisions everywhere from the owner level down through the manager and actual player level. If you're not into that level of detail, there are of course many ways to just \"play\". There are training levels to get you learning the basics. There are many training camp features that feature great graphic/gameplay combinations to really help you learn about blocking, throwing and more. Once you understand the game mechanics and keys, you can jump into a wide variety of games under all sorts of conditions to see how well you'd do. Like any strategy game, this is NOT a game just to pick up and expect to do well in after 5 minutes. If you're looking for an \"easy arcade\" kind of game, you might do better elsewhere. The strength of this release is with its details. Once you get into the great complexity of really handling a team, you learn real life lessons that help you understand how actual football teams are managed and developed. You can almost consider this game a training system for people who really want to enter the NFL and work there. You learn a great deal about how plays are designed, how managers coordinate the team's efforts and how owners work to make the team the best it can be. I found the 'background comments' far less annoying than in previous versions of Madden, but on the other hand the choice of music in the background wasn't the best. I'm a big fan of all varieties of music, but what they have playing just isn't enjoyable after the first listen or two. So it might be good to mute that and play your own stereo while you play. In general I highly recommend this for any football fan.

This in itself should make any gamer run out and grab one - when you compare the price of this to the price of one of the new consoles, you're saving tons of money! What does it do? For some games that work both with and without the expansion pack, it greatly increases the types of graphics shown during gameplay. Pod Racer is a stellar example. Play without the pack, and you get rings and blocky graphics. Add in the pack and you suddenly have lens flare, details of ships racing beside you, crucial information about upcoming turns. It makes the game play the way the developers intended. It's like watching The Matrix on a shoddy VHS tape copied from a friend, and then seeing it on DVD. It's an amazing difference for a very low price. In addition, many new games coming out are so graphic-intensive that they require the expansion pack to even play. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a key example. This is an EXCELLENT game with great extended gameplay, but you can't even start if you don't have this pack in place. It's not difficult to install - you simply plug it in once and it stays there permanently. You can still play older games with it in place.

Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories is the perfect game for the PSP. Let me say again - this is a MATURE game. There is sex, there is swearing, there is a LOT of violence. Anybody who buys this game for their 8 year old is making a grave mistake. It really bothers me a lot when people buy adult games for kids and say \"Oh I didn't know\". It clearly says right on the box. There are a TON of adult gamers out there, and we like mature games, just like we like R rated movies. These games aren't meant for kids. They are made exactly the way us adults like them - full of adult situations. That being taken care of, this is an *incredible* game. Let's start with the gameplay. It's hard to even imagine, looking at say a DS or GameBoy game, that any handheld could produce gameplay like this. You have a fully detailed, fully laid out cityscape. You can drive down any road, walk around amongst the people, watch the rain and sun and fog roll in. The storyline is great. The missions are great. Heck, even the sidegames are great. There are hidden packages to find, rankings to achieve, races to run, you name it. You could play this for months. The graphics are spellbindingly beautiful. It's hard to believe this is a handheld game. You get rain falling down around your car as it careens past easily identifiable stores on a road, while pedestrians stroll down the sidewalks. From shooting tasks, to driving races, to handling a number of other situations, the graphics draw you into this world. Let's talk about audio. There is a great selection of \"radio stations\" to listen to as you drive around. The voice acting really draws you into the story, to relate to the various characters involved. I've always loved the audio on the GTA games, and this is no exception. Yes, this game requires a 2.0 update to run. The update is INCLUDED ON THE DISK. Anybody who has trouble finding it must be missing some basic computer skills. It's right on the main disk menu when you put the disk into the system. It's free, it's included, it's easy. I can't say enough good things about this game. Let me try to figure out some down sides. Hmmm, well it's on a small screen. Heck, that's the whole point, that it's on a portable system. When I go on trips, I can bring it along with me. I think that's fantastic, to have a GTA system to bring on the plane or bus. I *did* find the storyline in general to be on the annoying side, truth be told. I really liked the original GTA3 storyline where you were a valued employee moving up in the ranks due to your skill. I found it frustrating in this one to play in essence an \"uppity jerk\" who is constantly put down either by his own mob buddies or his mom or other people. It didn't make the game nearly as enjoyable for me. This is my leisure time after all, to endulge in fun dreams. My fun dream isn't of being berated and harassed.  That being said, the mom in the Sopranos always drove me completely insane too. You have to give a writer the leeway to write his own story, and if that's what he wants to write, you go with it. This is a must-own game. It's a game for ADULTS. But it's a game with epic scope, great graphics, and great gameplay.

It features exceptional acting by the real cast! You don't have to watch the show to enjoy the game. In essence it's broken into two parts. In part 1, you're a detective and trying to solve a murder case. A well respected doctor is found shot in the head outside an apartment building. It's rather grisly, but you start searching. In part 2, you have tracked down a suspect and are now trying to prosecute him in court. So you use the evidence from before and question the various witnesses to prove the guy is guilty. The game is in essence the same as the first release (Dead on the Money) so the complaints and praise are pretty much similar. On the good side, you have a great cast, great acting and great plot line. So the game really does feel like you're in a well done TV drama and meeting interesting, multi-dimensional people. The puzzles are fun and challenging, and make sense in the context of the game. The ambient sounds and graphics are both rather good - when you're poking around an apartment, you hear footsteps outside as someone else heads to their room. On the downside, though, there is an AWFUL lots of mouse-waving around as you try to search every tiny little nook and cranny for things to examine in the various locations. If you don't click on the exact PIXEL of the item - even if you do have the \"help\" of turning the magnifying glass on - you miss it! Like real life, there are TONS of things to investigate in the room, and 99% of them are meaningless to the case. But it gets REALLY tedious to have to hear the reports of \"Sorry, I examined this as much as I could and just didn't find anything.\" over and over again from your team. I would REALLY just like to get a written report of what was WORTHY and then be able to click on those things that were interesting to hear more about them. In the same vein, your \"inventory of objects\" is limited. So you have to *throw away* evidence to pick up more!! Talk about bad police work!! You spend half your case throwing away things and hoping you don't need them later on. Why not have some sort of \"police locker\" to store them in until later just in case? Also, some of the questions were blatantly obnoxious and not ones I would ask a witness. But the game would get to the point where the \"other options\" would start to cycle through questions you'd already asked and in essence they force you to ask the obnoxious one. There should be choices on how to end an interview - and pissing off your witness shouldn't be the ONLY one. Finally, I play a TON of games on my system and usually don't have any trouble at all. But the video on this kept *vanishing* completely - and it happened in both windowed and full screen mode. I would have to completely shut down and restart the game to fix it ... for a while. Eventually it would happen again. Still, it's fun to put the pieces together and figure out just who did what with who in what location. There are fun twists and turns and things aren't always as they appear to be. So I'd say when you play this game don't expect a \"quick zip through\" - sit down, be very patience, be prepared to reboot the game a few times, drink a glass of wine. You'll find that if you take it slow, the game is quite fun and worth the time!</td><td>A few flaws but enjoyable gameplay</td><td>1067472000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>home</td><td>452770</td><td>2.0</td><td>324</td><td>false</td><td>10 3, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000COC5MK</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I really had high hopes for the Oster. We open a bottle of wine a day - sometimes more if we're having friends over. As a wine reviewer, I have numerous wine corkscrews and devices in my home to do this with. I have always searched for something easy and quick. This is a tall device - maybe a foot long - that you need to keep charged up. When you are ready to use it, you lower that cylinder over the wine cork and push a button. It draws the cork up and out of the bottle, fully removing it from the cork. Then you push the opposite button for the cork to eject from the device. It works well enough for a few runs - but then it quickly loses its traction. I have had this for a year now and keep hoping that it will start working again. It doesn't. The worm will go maybe halfway into a cork and then jam. It will stop turning. It works better with natural cork, and pretty much not at all for anything else. Also, because the worm goes all the way through the cork, it drills a hole straight through. First, this causes cork bits to eject out into the wine. Second, it means if you are planning on recorking the wine and storing it for later drinking, the wine will leak out unless you store it end-up. If you have dry or crumbling corks you're going to be in trouble. The usual two-prong remover is always going to work better in those solutions. I could see if you only drank \"real cork\" wine and only used this once a week or so that it might last you a while. If you were writing a review after a month of once-a-week usage you might think it was great. Unfortunately, if you are a more avid wine drinker, there are just too many situations where the device fails, and the worm wears down very quickly. Plus, the fact that you have to leave this plugged in all the time makes it an energy leach. In a world where we are all trying to cut down on the power we draw from the electrical system, and keep our cell phones and such unplugged when we can, to leave a corkscrew plugged in all the time seems very wasteful. I definitely recommend a Rabbit instead. It works VERY easily, draws the cork out in one easy pull, and requires no electricity at all.</td><td>Nice Idea - Poor Long Term Usefulness</td><td>1222992000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>21586</td><td>5.0</td><td>7</td><td>false</td><td>10 3, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00005A3I5</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Designed along the lines of Age of Empires, with some of the same programmers, Empire Earth stretches from prehistory into the far future. Think of it as the standard build-a-civilization game with a timeline that encompasses all of mankind's history. The graphics are really great. It seems that every new release raises the graphics bar a bit, and Empire Earth falls into that category. It's a fully 3D version of Age of Empires, with little farms, temples, stables, trees, airports, towers, and more. The water ripples, the trees sway in the wind. There are different terrain types, from snow to desert to rocks and jungle. The plants and landscape features match the terrain properly. There are all sorts of great units matching the various time periods. There are frigates and battleships, galleons and triremes and catapult ships. The fully customizable scenario editor lets you mix and match the forces in one giant time-warp map, or construct your own historic scenarios. Drop an iceberg into the water, and you see the water lapping up against its edges. You can zoom fully in and out to admire your work! The game campaigns are a fun trek through history. Start out with sticks and stones, and just a few units. Take care of your goats, and soon you'll be progressing along through the Greeks, Romans, middle ages, Renaissance and all the way up to the far future. The range of units, cultures and timelines available is truly amazing. The campaigns are just to whet your appetite and get you started. When you're sure you understand the commands and tactics, it's time to go on line! You'll find thousands of maps, thousands of players, and a truly infinite number of scenarios to play out. Design any historical situation and see how you do in WW2 or in the War of the Roses. Try various combinations in the war against Cleopatra.

Command and Conquer: Renegade is their entry into the first person shooter arena. The familiar sides of GDI and NOD are present, and all of your favorite weapons and vehicles are available for enjoyment. The graphics are *really* nice, and shine in quite a number of areas. Well worth making sure you have a GEforce 3 or 4 for. Another great feature is that you can enter vehicles and even share them with friends. One person can jump into the driver's seat and the other can leap into the back to man the guns. There are APCs for transporting small teams. The loading and recoil graphics on the weapons feel very realistic. You've got your weapons that you know and love from the various command and conquer games, including the laser rifle, chain gun, grenade launcher, flame thrower, chemical sprayer and more. A sniper rifle lets you zoom in on the action. Sure, single player can be a bit boring. But as in most of these first person shooters, the internet multiplay is where the game really shines. Single player is really just a training arena until you 'graduate' to on line play. You can play with a team of 10 or more friends from around the world, working together as a group to coordinate your attack against the enemies. Just as in command and conquer, you have a base and have to defend it while destroying your enemy's base. You can blow up your enemy's bases by blasting them from the outside, or blowing them up from the inside! With the HUGE number of HalfLife players out there, this is a giant step up in terms of graphics. The vehicles also make a great addition. It compares nicely with Halo, although Halo can't support large team play and isn't \"really\" internet enabled right now.

You're a schoolboy taking on the stereotypical cliques. It's pretty clear why you're a depressed teenage boy when the game starts. Apparently your dad has died, and your mom has remarried an elderly, grumpy old man who wants you out of the picture. Your mom is more than happy to dump you off at a stay-all-year school while she goes off with Mr. Moneybucks. On top of that, the school officials are pretty nasty to you right from the start. Hogwarts this is not! Then as you go into the run-down dorm, other kids start beating up on you! It's time for you to stand up for yourself and make a stand. There are various groups of kids in this school - the nerds, the jocks, the greasers and the preppies. Activities you do raise or lower your respect level with each group. You have to go to class too - and be there on time! If you're able to manage your schedule properly, you can participate in some pretty fun mini-games (the word scramble can be challenging!) to earn you new skills. There are girls to court, and usually they want a specific item. So you have numerous quests to go on. The bully activities range from escorting a nerd safely to his locker, to running races and protecting yourself from attacks. You get clothing along the way, and can customize your look (within school regulations, of course). It's a bit depressing, sometimes, to see how these mid-teen guys treat each other, but this does actually happen in many schools. I'm sure pretty much every person who was once a teen can name the cliques that existed in their school. The graphics are rather good for a PS2, and the sounds, while again a bit depressing for a teen environment, work well with the game too. On one hand I can not really like the swearing in the game, but certain teens do in fact swear far worse than this game does! I'd even say this is more like Fable than other Grand Theft Autos, with some of the ways that you can choose how you react in situations. This game won't be enjoyed by people who are squeamish about violence - it does, after all, involve teen guys all bashing each other for very inane reasons. It also involves a lot of bullying - as you might imagine. Still, if you can deal with those issues, you'll find a really involving game that might actually make you think about how to treat others well.</td><td>School Days Aren't Always Fun and Happy</td><td>1162080000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>72251</td><td>4.0</td><td>40</td><td>false</td><td>10 29, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000AOEV6A</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Battlefield 2 - Modern Combat is a great arcade-style fast paced action game. Just be prepared for some odd graphic issues while you play. The gameplay involves a squad of soldiers moving through a well laid out cityscape.  You can see the dirt on the window panes, the signs along the road, the icicles on the rooflines.  You play in various weather conditions and deal with fire, smoke, and other environmental distractions. It's amazing that we have gotten so \"spoiled\" that we take all of that for granted, and can complain about small anomalies. For example, we found it greatly amusing that when you shoot a jeep, it blows into a million tiny shards and vanishes completely. We also laughed when you shot an enemy soldier and apparently your bullets are \"bone-dissolving\" because they collapse like a jello-creature. Still, that hardly takes away from the real gameplay. Your squad each has different weapons and capabilities, and in an ability I found REALLY cool, you can instant-teleport from one to the other as long as you can establish a sight-line. It was like having cosmic vampiric abilities. Also, to add to replayability, there are a ton of special medals and bonus points you can get, for things like achieving the longest hot-swap, doing long jeep jumps, and destroying all of the road signs. There is some strategy involved here. You can't just run down the road blasting and expect to survive. You have to take cover, move along carefully and take your shot when it's clear. That being said, you don't have the squad level of command that some other games feature. You can't get an overhead view and set your guys up in formation, planning things out at a \"manager\" level. Your guys have reasonably good AI and act as best they can. If you want one of them to do something in particular, you have to \"take them over\". The soundtrack is reasonably good - it gives a underlying 'movie feel' to the game without really intruding on gameplay. The soldier chatter that goes on is on one hand done reasonably well, but on the other hand it gets tiresome after a while. I'd almost like the ability to toggle between 'chatty' comrades at the beginning of the game down to 'pensive and quiet' ones near the end of the game. This game of course has an online component to it. It's funny how some people feel online is the \"only way\" to play a game - while thousands of other people don't have online connections and honestly don't want them. I've played a ton of online XBox games, but also love playing solo. In any case, if you WANT to play online, you have to make sure your net connection as tuned as possible. The game supports 24 simultaneous players so as you can imagine the potential for lag is incredible. Find players that have top notch connections and make sure yours is as high speed as possible as well.

The graphics are really impressive, and the character customization adds a great new dimension to fighting gameplay. There are whole complex back-stories to all of the characters, developed over the game series. You can go into the 'museum' in this game to learn all about that, if you haven't been keeping up with the series. That will help you really understand the interactions between the characters. It's like being a part of a complex, epic story. The graphics are simply gorgeous. There are pirate ships, where the floor moves and sways beneath you. There are elegant Chinese temples with mosaic tile floors and lovely mountains in the background. You've got renaissance mansions in flames, cages in grimy port towns, and much more. Each environment has moving elements to add to the realism. The sounds are pretty traditional. Most of it is BASH - SMASH - YAAAAH! along with the background music, themed to match the environment. I do love this kind of background music far better than games that have rock music. Gameplay itself has good and bad points. On the good side, there are a GREAT combinations you can learn for your character, so if you are diligent you can come up with awesome fighting sequences. You can learn which combos match well against your enemy's weaknesses and exploit them. On the other hand, if you're more the type that likes to button mash, you can have a fair amount of success with that, although you will get frustrated in the higher level battles. The game is marked for teens, although it's far more tame than other fighting games I've seen. Many of the females *gasp* actually wear clothing. There really isn't any blood involved in the combat, although  some parents argue that little tykes shouldn't see swinging swords and flails at all. There's no swearing. That being said, the game is fairly challenging, and unlike the previous game, there's no way to set the difficulty up or down. If you play one on one you can adjust the difficulty so the younger person can have an easier time, but for regular gameplay you're stuck with \"hard\". I find this to be a shame. While experienced players will get along OK, it really would've been nice for new players to have an 'easy' option to go through the game in, to learn the game and have fun. They could always have upgraded through 'normal' and 'hard' later on. With the customizeable characters and multitude of opponents, you can really replay this game for months without getting bored with it. There are always new combinations to learn and perfect.

The game lives up to its hype - both good and bad. I'm writing a walkthrough for this game, so have been playing it pretty much non-stop since its release. First, the gameplay. If you've been living in a cave and haven't heard of this game, it is definitely MATURE. The other two GTA3 games were mildly mature. This one is full blown mature. There is more swearing in 5 minutes of the game than in most full length R-rated movies. You are beating up people with baseball bats, having drive-by gang shootings, and more. This isn't a game for kids. That being said, there is a lot here to entertain adults who are into gang life and rap music. The graphics are really quite amazing, and the maps are HUGE. You can drive all over intricately detailed streets, hopping in and out of whatever cars you see. There are different areas of town, each with its own look and feel. The music immerses you in this world which is both bad and good. If you love the rap / hiphop music, you're all set. But unlike the other games that gave you a wide selection of music to choose from, in San Andreas you're pretty stuck with that one genre. I suppose there is one country station, plus the traditional (and fun) talk station too. Gameplay is typical GTA style. You go on missions. In your missions you shoot the bad guys and go on object-finding hunts. There are tags to spray paint, people to talk to and deeds to do. A lot of blood is spilled along the way. An addition to San Andreas is the customization of your character. You're a black male adult, and can go into barber shops to change your hairstyle at whim. You can also hop into a tattoo shop to add tats to various parts of your body. As you eat and run, you can get muscular, slim, fat or so on. If you eat too much and get fat, it slows you down. If you don't eat enough, you end up weak. Balance is key here. The game is flying out of stores at an incredible rate, and the pre-orders for it were collossal. Loyal fans will not be disappointed - the game really amps up every aspect. Those who want to complain about the violence and language will find plenty to be upset about - but remember, this game is for adults only. It clearly says mature on the box. So if an adult chooses to play this game and have fun with it - well, that's their decision to make!</td><td>Amazingly good game - but pay attention to the MATURE rating</td><td>1099008000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>36068</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 29, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000696CZ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I am a HUGE fan of Grand Theft Auto and literally got Grand Theft Auto: Vice City the day it became available. I've been playing it since the moment it got home, and it is truly a GREAT follow-up to the GTA3 blockbuster. The premise is simple. Think Miami Vice. You're in Vice City, lots of cocaine dealers, the Italians want to get involved. You've just gotten out of prison and are sent down to get the 'family' presence known. Your first job goes wrong and everyone is killed. Now you have to get the cash and drugs back for the family. As your reputation grows, more and more people want you to work for them. The game is just classic. From the low-resolution intro screen to the GREAT music from Judas Priest to Michael Jackson to Bryan Adams, this is a BLAST for anyone over 25 who remembers these years. Younger players will enjoy it too but might miss all the great references! The improvements over GTA3 are numerous. You get motorcycles now, complete with appropriate body leanings. Mopeds too! There are seaplanes, boats and helicopters. Even golf carts! You'll see some of your favorite cars from GTA3 (including the BF Injection) plus many new ones. In addition to a gun shop you also have a tool shop for those who dislike firearms. The dialogue is just *classic*, although they went a BIT heavy with every other swear being a reference to the male sex organ. In the REAL Miami Vice, they had a bit more imagination! Still, that is probably my only complaint in a game that is incredibly rich. The graphics are improved. The radio stations are AMAZING. Yes, this is NOT for kids.

In some ways, it lives up to the standards of the series; in others, it overextends itself. In WOTS3, you play as a wandering samurai caught in the kingdom of Amana during the Warring States period. There are several factions you can choose to ally yourself with: the powerful Fujimori clan, the rural Ouka clan, or the oppressed farmers of Takatane. The game has an open world, so you can wander around doing what you want - doing jobs and gaining the trust of the various factions to accomplish something in the world, or just spending your time picking fights and upgrading your sword. The game is meant to be played many times - it's short, but there are so many variations in the endings that it's clearly meant to be replayed over and over. WOTS3 offers you more influence in the world than previous games. While WOTS1 and WOTS2 both allowed you a wide variety of choices as to your behavior in the world, in terms of who you could kill and where you could go, you were severely limited. In WOTS3, anyone can be killed at any time as long as you can get to them. It's possible to draw your sword during almost any cutscene in the entire game; if you want to, you can just cut a bloody swath through every important character, take their stuff, and leave. On the flipside, if you're actually trying to accomplish something and get a good ending, it's important to be more diplomatic. WOTS3 offers two different concessions to the idea of peace. The first of these is the ability to apologize; in previous games, if you accidentally drew your sword, you had to fight or run away. In WOTS3, it's possible to attempt to reconcile and avoid fighting, which can be crucial if you've spent all your time building up trust with one clan and almost ruin it accidentally. The other new feature is the ability to attack non-lethally; you can defeat an enemy, but they won't be killed permanently. Since every single character in the game is persistent in the world, this can be important if a necessary character picks a fight with you and won't accept your surrender. You may find it necessary to fight back, but also to keep the person alive. The swordfighting system feels slightly less refined than in WOTS2, but it makes up for it with improved customization. Like previous games, there are a few basic styles that swords can be used in, as well as some exotic options like ninja swords and iaijutsu. WOTS3 changes a few  things as far as weapons go. Spears have been added to the game, to go with the more medieval tone of the setting. Additionally, dual-wielding now involves two actual swords, rather than one \"sword\" that's actually a set of two. Finally, you now have the option to create your own swords or spears from parts that can be found or bought in the game world. These weapons have their stats determined by the parts you use, so saving all your best parts to build a super high-quality sword is usually a good idea. As gameplay goes, the most annoying part in comparison to other games in the series is how disconnected everything feels. The story is moved along through \"inklings\", which show up on your map occasionally to let you know to go to a certain area. However, many of these inklings are non-intuitive. For example, while playing as a member of the Fujimori clan, I ended up at a dead end where nothing was happening. As it turned out, I had to go join the rival Ouka clan, then immediately leave. It made no sense and felt really awkward. The jobs you have to do to gain faction approval are a pain, too. Some of them are ok - go here, kill one guy. Others have you hunting around the map for a hidden person or item, many of whom won't show up due to bugs or bad programming. In one case, I found two of three people that I needed to find, and couldn't find the last one no matter where I looked. I then left the map and came back; when I returned, the third person was sitting in a place that I had definitely checked before. Another gameplay gimmick added is the presence of \"partners\" - romantic interests for your samurai to pursue. These partners have no role in the main gameplay; rather, you have to go out looking for them and fulfill whatever requirements they have for you to \"recruit\" them. For example, one partner threatens to attack you to avenge her dead father (she has mistaken you for his killer), and to recruit her you must apologize to her rather than fighting back. Another shows up only at midnight, and can be hired as a bodyguard for the night. However, these partners are more annoying than helpful - some offer small advantages, like remote access to your weapons safe and so on, but they all run much slower than you do and you'll be forced to constantly stop to let them catch up, or just walk everywhere. There are some mini-games you can do that require you to have a partner, and if you hang out with a partner long enough they can become a romantic interest, but other than that there's really not that much they're good for. Overall, they're just a pain. The game's graphical quality varies pretty wildly - people and weapons are done pretty well, but the environmental textures are bland and unappealing. The main character especially is good at expressing emotion, but the buildings look really fake and the maps are lined with invisible walls and other issues that seem really silly to still have in 2009.  Despite some improvements, as a whole WOTS3 is not a graphically impressive game - it's not quite as bad as last-gen, but it's not up to the standards of current generation graphics. The sound design in the game is similarly varied in quality. The music is interesting and atmospheric. The voice work in Japanese is pretty good, but the English dub is lazy and not even worth bothering with. Thankfully, the game provides both English and Japanese as options. There's a really weird bug with voices, though, which is that the volume of a person's voice is based on the camera's proximity to the speaker - not based on the character's proximity. The result is that, because it's a third-person game, you won't be able to hear anyone unless you swing the camera around so that the person speaking is right in front of you. It's really weird and annoying and just ruins the experience. As a whole, WOTS3 is an ambitious game, and I can respect that. However, it's so sloppily put together that the few areas where it is fun are overshadowed by repetitive tasks and shoddy development. It's a good example of combining story and gameplay, but in terms of being a fun game it's kind of lacking.

There's a lot of things to blow up, but not a lot of plot. I appreciate that you can be a male or female character, and that they customize the dialogue and situations around the type of character you have chosen. The graphics are reasonably OK, although not nearly up to the level of most other current release games. For example, I was convinced there were leaves falling around me in one scene, but eventually realized they were bizarre moth creatures which were \"clipping\" into the ground. You have minimal choices at times - do you kill your targets, or bring them in as prisoners? Most of the time you are just tracking down more weapons, blowing up more items, gathering up more money. There are mini-games that help you hone your skills, but even these are pretty simple - shoot at some targets, blow up some statues. We cranked the dollar value for each game up to the maximum and got through them rather easily. That's not to say the game isn't fun if you simply take it as a destruction game. It can be fun blowing up buildings, blowing up cars, shooting things of course. However, as an actual mission based game, along the lines of Grand Theft Auto, Saint's Row or even Just Cause, there is a lot missing here. It's sort of like a \"light\" version of those games. If you really enjoy blow-things-up game then certainly this game could be perfect for you. Not every game needs a plot! Heck, I love Super Mario games. If you're on the fence, though, rent this one first and see how long the appeal lasts for you. It might be that a weekend of it is enough. On the other hand, if you find you really get into the game and enjoy that let-loose aspect of it, you can then buy it. For me, though, there's enough blow-up aspects in several other games I own that I would rather play them than to play this one.</td><td>Blowing-Up Fun but Light on Gameplay</td><td>1225152000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>164892</td><td>3.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0018YDK90</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Crash - Mind Over Mutant is the latest in the Crash Bandicoot series, a platformer which can be played by one or two players. I really had high hopes for this game, as I generally love platformers. Unfortunately, it just does not hold up. It's sort of hard to put your finger exactly on why the game isn't fun to play. The graphics are nice enough, a good balance between realistic movement and cartooney shininess. The characters are cute, optimistic, and have the usual collection of bouncing, climbing, spinning and other movements. There are monsters you encounter that you can take control of. Each monster has special abilities that you can use to solve puzzles. For example you run into an ice monster and can use him to freeze water. There was a fair amount of potential here, but the gameplay really feels tedious and boring. The dialogue is painful. I realize this is for kids - we play a LOT of games meant for kids and they are generally quite fun! I had several people try this one and usually you have to pry the controller away from people that are playing a platformer. With this one, they would slog through an area or two and then want to stop playing. Digging aimlessly through underground areas looking for a shiny object or two? Slashing away at giant dandelions? These are only the first few fun tasks you take on in your duties. There are so many other great platformers out there that are incredibly fun to play and replay - the Ratchet & Clank series, the Jak & Daxter series. We would spend weeks and weeks playing those games and enjoying every moment of it. That we had to force ourselves to play through this one was really a key indicator that it just wasn't right. We love platforming - we are this game's target audience. It just wasn't well done. If you really want to give it a try, rent it from your local game rental store or website. That way you can test it out first. If it happens to match your particular gaming style, then by all means by it - but I'm afraid most platforming fans will find it lacking.</td><td>Well Meaning but Just Not Fun</td><td>1225152000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>112797</td><td>5.0</td><td>14</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2007</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000TGDHW8</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I adore the Guitar Hero series.

Some of the songs are SUPER in this set and got me up off the couch dancing around while I played along. The new battle mode is a ton of fun. Before, you'd get a simple encore at the end of each set. This time you occasionally have to fight a newcomer for guitar supremacy. In battle mode you earn \"attacks\" that you can then lob at your opponent. These do things like break strings, make you play double notes, make your screen shake, and much more. It is super fun.

My boyfriend is a Sudoku addict! I honestly have to say that Sudoku Mania is the *worst* of anything we have tried. You can chose a few options - the difficulty of the puzzle, the number of items per grid (2x2, 3x3) and solving with numbers or symbols. You also choose the theme of your puzzle, which change the look and feel of the game. Then you launch into the automatically generated puzzle. The layout they chose to use is simply awful. The top display shows the puzzle. The bottom area has four TINY arrows that you can click on to move your \"selection cube\" up, down, left or right. You have to click precisely to move your cursor around. So you're watching the top screen and clicking in tiny spots on the bottom screen to position your cursor to the cube you want to work on. Yes, you can use the D-Pad as well. Once you select a spot, you use the stylus to tap ONE NUMBER to put into that cube. You can't put in several numbers to indicate what you are currently working on!! Did the developers even play Sudoku before developing this game? No other game misses this most basic technique of playing Sudoku. Oh, if you put an incorrect number in - where the number is already in a row or column - it flashes. So much for using your brain to solve the puzzle. Not that you really can solve some of these puzzles - their autogenerator seems to have faults and not all games are intuitively solvable. All of these issues would already have put this game at the bottom of the list, but even their font choices are poor! Looking at the grid, some of the numbers look like other numbers. The contrast is poor so it's hard to see any of them. Again, these are basic issues that really should have been fixed. It's rather obvious that these guys were out to capitalize on the Sukoku mania and figured that once someone bought the game because it said \"Sudoku\", they'd be unable to return it. With all the other Sudoku games out on the market, there's really no reason to get this one.

The graphics are really the standout improvement here from previous Dragonball Z games. They do a great job of really maxing out the capabilities of the PS2. Not only are the cut scenes great, but the main gameplay features *giant* maps, with multiple terrain types (water, mountains, plants and more). You can move up to higher ground, draw your enemy into the lake to slow them down, and use other tactics. It makes the game much more like \"playing in the Dragonball Z world\" vs being a side-scrolling fighter. The sound is definitely enhanced over previous versions, too. You can now choose to have the Japanese voices for your characters. It's ironic that in early days of gaming, games would come with only Japanese voices and US people would complain because they wanted to hear English. Nowadays we appreciate the language much better. By giving you the option, you can use whichever suits you best. That's not to say that *all* sound in the game is stellar. They definitely could have included a more robust musical soundtrack - and general commentary. It often seems like those things are overlooked in fighting games, but if you're a fan and playing the game for multi hours a day, pretty much every day of the week, it wears on you quickly. For actual gameplay, as mentioned, the maps are great. They have tons of characters which is really wonderful. It's fun to see some of the more obscure characters they included in the set. The movements and animations are great. However, the *controls* to get them to do things - and the skill of the AI at doing the same moves - are really unbalanced. We have played thousands of games on all systems over our reviewing career and there is just something not right about the combat controls here. So while you're struggling to get the combos activated, the enemy you're fighting is zipping through them smoothly and trouncing you. This is something you can \"deal with\" if you're patient and into the series - but if you're not an avid gamer, I can see someone getting frustrated very quickly and not playing the game again. I'm all for having games that are difficult! I enjoy the challenge. But a game should be difficult because you are ramping up in technique. It shouldn't be difficult because the combo you typed in isn't accepted, or the key strokes react sluggishly so that your character dies before your commands are \"heard\". Definitely a big step in the right direction - I really hope #2 takes care of a lot of these control issues. If they do, that will be a 5/5. For this version, I'll give it a 4/5 as a great game but with some issues.</td><td>Great Improvement, Stil a Few Issues</td><td>1161993600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>86406</td><td>4.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000FVM49Y</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Ace Combat X : Skies of Deception brings the air combat world of the Ace Combat series to the PSP handheld. It's a rather good port of a quite fun series. Ace Combat is, in general, a flying game involving modern style airplanes of a wide variety - F15, F18, F22, A10 and so on. You fly with a few wingmen, fighting for a fictional country against its enemy. The game is made up of a series of missions, sometimes air to air, sometimes air to ground, sometimes over sea, sometimes over cities. The PSP version is less linear and more strategic. You can choose which territory to work on next. On the other hand, you don't have any control over your wingmen in this version - they usually try to stick close to you, but you can't issue them orders or outfit their planes. The graphics are rather good for PSP abilities. They have anime style cut scenes but they are non-moving, stationary images. If you had to compare the in game graphics they would fall somewhere between Ace Combat 3 and Ace Combat 4. Oddly, the game doesn't do a good job of showing \"how fast\" you are going, with the portrayal of objects around you. So it can be hard to judge distances or dogfighting situations. The sound is on the tinny side and has a new annoying voice which repeats the \"caution\" style alerts. The techno-beat soundtrack can get wearying after a while. Trying to use the little stub joystick at the same time as the D Pad can be extremely frustrating. I know that there aren't many choices when using a PSP, but surely they could have come up with another combination of keystrokes that worked well. In general, the PSP version is much slower than the PS2. When we play the PSP, then go back and play Ace Combat Zero, it's amazing how much faster the gameplay moves in Zero. There is a multiplayer mode, which can include both other PSP players as well as computer players. If you have friends who own PSPs and this game, that could be a fun way to pass a few hours. Well recommended as a playing alternative, for when you're away from your PS2!</td><td>Rather Good Port to the PSP Handheld</td><td>1161993600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>86748</td><td>5.0</td><td>21</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000FW6MFK</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Destroy All Humans series is brilliant. With #2, you are now in the 1960s, with hippies and KBG agents all around you. If you didn't play the original Destroy All Humans games, it involved grey, big-eyed aliens coming down to earth in the 1950s. You ran around reading their thoughts, taking over their minds, and slaying them. Half of the fun was the incredibly funny sense of humor in the game as you interacted with these humans of the 50s. With Destroy All Humans 2, we jump forward to the 1960s. The President of the US (JFK) was apparently a female-loving space alien. The KBG realize this and try to help out. The next thing you know, the aliens are on attack again - and you're in charge. You run around city maps, watching as hippy chicks shout out \"Back off, Pig!\" and reading their minds. You can mentally throw objects, take over bodies, and much more. This game is much more \"active\" than other adventure games - you have to hammer on buttons to get actions to occur. You can't just passively press one button and be all set. The graphics are great. You really get immersed into the world of the 60s, with the appropriate cars, the hippy vans, the murals painted on walls. The outfits people wear are super. There are the traditional items to collect, objectives to achieve and people to slay. But again, most of the fun is in what you hear along the way. The commentary is hilarious. The thoughts you overhear can get you laughing out loud. If humans happy to see you doing something \"alieny\", you can zap them with free love - and the daisies dancing in their brain, along with the hippy music, will soon distract them from any troublesome thoughts of grey aliens. Even better, if you have a friend come and visit, you can do co-op play! Now, there are a few anachronisms - didn't \"Love the One you're With\" come out in 1970? Or maybe they're saying Stephen Stills got his inspiration from a hippy dude named The Freak. In any case, I'm sure Destroy All Humans 3 will be set in the 70s, so we'll get enough of that soon enough. In the meantime, be sure to get your hands on this version, and help bring peace to the world!</td><td>One of those must-have games</td><td>1161993600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>72049</td><td>5.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000AB603U</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I've been waiting for Age of Empires III ever single I finally finished exhausting all of the fun from Age of Empires II. I really think it was well worth the wait. First, it is VERY much like Age of Empires II. That is a HUGE bonus for me. I love the Age of Empires series and if they'd changed the whole gameplay a great deal, it would have lost a lot of what I adore about this series. I can literally play each of these games for months and months before I begin to get bored. That is the brilliance of a well designed real time strategy (RTS) game. Next, the graphics are of course MUCH improved over previous versions. That of course means you need a much faster machine than you had before! Hopefully most people out there upgrade their computers regularly, to run ANY packages that come out each year - the newest release of PhotoShop, the newest games that come out. If you have a slow, old machine and can't run the newest games, well you really only have yourself to blame. I NEVER want game makers to make bad games just so they can run on ancient machines. It's their duty to make the best games possible. It's my job to get the machine that are current, to run them. OK, so on to gameplay. You get a collection of fun cultures, each one nicely costumed and with appropriate vocals and sounds. I love the detail in the homes, the people, the environments. You can \"skirmish\" to your heart's content, learning about the strengths and weaknesses and looks of each group. But don't go thinking you can memorize what works in each situation. The game does nicely to add complexity to that cookie-cutter approach. Instead, you have a great deal of customization ability, even on the fly. You can really build your style of culture to match your personal point of view, within cultural limits of course. This means when you face others in combat, you can never assume \"Oh they're an X which means I just have to do Y\". You have to watch, react, and implement a new plan. I really enjoyed the graphics a great deal here, from the cantering horses to the forests and smoke and flames. They did a great job of really making you feel that there is a little world being run inside your computer monitor. The sounds are equally good, with the voices and sounds, the background noises and alerts.  I admit the trumpet calls get a little repetitive, but what can you do. I suppose to some the downside is the fact that you need a modern machine. Again, I don't consider that a downside. It's an awesome game with a lot going on. It's not meant to run on a little 386. It's hard for old system owners to accept, but the world moves on. If you're going to play modern games, you have to move along with it. Believe me, it's only going to get worse as more games come out. It's time to grab that piggy bank and upgrade. I did find it really amusing that the scenario begins with the Aztecs. We just spent Black and White II fighting those All-Powerful Aztecs. What is it with the Aztecs in modern games??

In the Katamari games, you are rolling a sticky ball. That's it! It's amazing how addictive it can get. This is the second game out, after Katamari Damacy. You are a prince. Your dad is the eternally bizarre and self-absorbed King of All Cosmos. He sets a series of challenges up for you, with the aim of creating stars. You wander along a grassy meadow, meeting up with people and choosing which challenge to work on next. The graphics are just amazing here, in a cartooney sort of way. You wander through an undersea world, rolling up various sea creatures. You roll around a home office, gathering typical office supplies. In each case you start with a little ball. As you roll the ball over an object, if it's small enough, it sticks onto your ball and you can actually see it rolling around. As you pick up more items, the ball gets larger and larger. You're ranked, depending on which section of the game you're in, on how quickly you make your ball grow large, on how large you get the ball to be, and various other ranking schemes. The music is fine, although I would have liked a little more variety. It's just a little too techno for me, all the time. I like to hear a variety of music types in a game like this. This is really a game that is PERFECT for all ages. There's no bloody shooting of enemies. There are no super complex puzzles to solve. All you do is roll, roll roll. It's very soothing, in a way, a mindless way to rid yourself of the stress of work or school. You're achieving something, and you just roll along to do it. My only complaint is that the co-op mode is rather challenging. It's tricky to get two people to roll a ball together. With this being such a great game for kids, I *really* wish they could think up a way for a parent to play with their kid (or even a grandparent to play with their kid). It's a game that appeals to all age levels - but there just isn't much of a way for those people to play \"together\". Surely there'd be some way to do that - maybe give one character a 'freeze ray' to stop items that are in motion, so the other character can then go roll them up. In any case, the game is quite a lot of fun, for those times that you want a relaxing, mindless, casual game. Well recommended!

It is completely addictive, fun, and even raises your intelligence! OK I can't be exactly sure about that last one, but I do a lot of research on how to keep your mind sharp and alert, and this game is PERFECT for just about everything they say. In essence, this game includes a TON of minigames and you are never given instructions for what to do. At most you get one or two words to give you a hint - like \"push\" or \"shoot\". Then you have only a tiny amount of time to look at what is shown to you and figure out how to play the game. Talk about testing your grey cells! The amazing part of this game is that the unit has a motion sensor in it. You turn the actual gameboy unit, and the game reacts. Some games involve spinning - a skater moves out onto the ice and you give the unit a quick \"whip\" to get her spinning like a top. Some games involve pushing a button, to fire an arrow for example. Many games involve spinning AND pushing, like when you turn the system to point to a given sushi piece and hit the button to eat it. The collection of games is just amazing. You unlock them as you go. Each game has multiple levels, so as you move on in difficulty, the games get harder and harder. There is HUGE fun in replaying the games, and they get incredibly quick and tricky near the end of the game. In addition to all the fun games, there are a ton of special items to unlock - from toys to more mini-games, from random accessories to silly gadgets. There's even a set of mini Nintendo games, like Zelda, complete with the theme music! It's really quite fun. If you really like a particular mini-game, you can go back and replay just that mini-game as much as you wish. Every person I've shown this to - from kid to aged adult - has LOVED the game. Some of the adults I know are really addicted to it now. Highly, highly recommended!

It's slightly tedious but generally fun. You are a girl who is turning 14 tomorrow. You've just discovered that your father is alive, after 10 years of living with your aunt Jessica.  There is a LOT of talking involved as you go through your tasks. You take a ship to Blood Edward Island, to meet your father. Of course he's not there to meet you, so you begin your adventure of exploring the island. In no time at all you've met \"D\", a ghost representation of a boy about your age. You two quickly decide you're soulmates, as both of you are looking to find your father and explore your memories. The puzzles are reasonably complex - the game is rated \"teen\" so this game wasn't meant for the little ones. They expect you to have at least a reasonable ability to remember clues and figure out puzzles. That being said, a lot of the puzzles are maddening because it's obvious what you have to do. It's just your CHARACTER that is completely clueless and doesn't get it. You have to click, click, click until she finally gets it. Sometimes you can't even pick up an object that you figure you'll need until you go somewhere else, see the \"destination object\", then trek back to the first object and pick it up then. Another issue I have is that some of the puzzles involve a lot of mindless screen rubbing. In one situation you have to clear a brass sign of rust. That means you have to sit there scrubbing your DS screen repeatedly until all of the rust comes off. There's enough wear and tear on a DS screen (and yes I do have a screen protector on it) to worry about the sensors wearing out, without actively doing something like this to it. Finally, there is a lot of random screen clicking that you have to do to even find things. You look at a sign and you SEE the pieces of it beneath the sign - but when you click on them it just says they are wooden pieces. You have to click in an exact spot to actually rearrange them. You look at a gate and it looks like a plain gate. You have to click on it further to see the lock mechanism.  It means you waste a lot of time randomly clicking all over just in case something is active. This girl should have better eyes than that. That all being said, I really do love puzzle games in general. The idea of a young teen girl trying to figure out who she is is rather cliche, but it gives her the chance to be both 'going out on her own' and 'nervous about being alone'. Having the ghost boy tag along is a nice touch - it's not too long ago that the main character would have \"of course\" been male, maybe with a helpless female sidekick. I'll give this a 3.5/5 for a fun concept and nice graphics, but a little too short and tedious. Maybe the gamemakers will come out with a sequel that is more filled out and easier to use.</td><td>Great Concept but Short and a Bit Annoying</td><td>1130457600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>66648</td><td>4.0</td><td>131</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009I6S0Y</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>We really love the Ratchet and Clank series of games, with the gameplay, humor and general mayhem. Deadlocked is NOT an adventure game like the others - it's a gladiator combat game. You don't even have Clank with you for most of the game. It's not that this game is \"bad\" - but it's different. I really did like the whole exploring-worlds theme of the previous games. The gladiator matches in those were interesting diversions but I was always happy when they were over. In this game, that's all that you get. You go from arena to arena, mindlessly bashing away at enemies and trying to stay alive. There are all sorts of mini-games that you unlock along the way - hoverbike races involving traditional follow-the-circles, shooting games, flying games, and much more. The humor is still quite fun, although it's now a very odd mix of very adult humor and very kiddy humor. The game is rated Teen so the adult humor is reasonably OK I suppose, depending on how protective you are of younger teens. The weapons upgrades are as usual amazingly fun - and you get to have \"mods\" to your weapons like acid and napalm to customise them to your liking. You can do all sorts of mixes and matches to get just the feel that you want. The graphics are of good quality - I've always enjoyed the graphic style of the Ratchet and Clank games so this provides more of the same. The sound is reasonably good, although we do find some really repetitive, annoying tracks in there. We also had the game completely freeze up on us a few times. Maybe it needed just a little more QA before it was released. The multiplayer modes are a really nice extension of the game. I really enjoy playing a game with a friend, so anything with co-op in it is great. I suppose on the up side that if this had not come out, we would have just been sitting here twiddling our thumbs until the next \"real\" release of Ratchet and Clank came out. So in that sense, I'm really happy to have this out as filler, to keep us busy until then. We definitely ran out to grab this as soon as it was released, even though it wasn't (as far as we were concerned) a fully fledged Ratchet and Clank game to plow through. Well Recommended!

I have two words for you - deformable terrain! The game has amazing graphics, as you'd expect on a PS2, a decent soundtrack, and an involving storyline. You're in a mining colony on Mars. The colony has a mysterious plague wiping people out, and an underground movement is pointing out that the mining corporation isn't very ethical. So you get sucked into the revolution against the company, and are being helped out by the rebels. There's really cool glass-shattering effects, submarines to ride in, Ultor Corporation baddies to blow away, and the plague to figure out. Lots of weapons and levels to plow through. But what makes this game so much better than its HalfLife siblings is the TERRAIN. In say HalfLife or most other games of this ilk, you shoot a wall and it gets charred. You can leave bullet holes in things, or maybe shoot out the window. Red Faction brings this to an ENTIRELY new level by letting you MODIFY THE TERRAIN with your attacks. Yes, this means if someone has locked a door you want to get through, you blast out the wall next to the door and go through the hole you've made! Know that the room below you has something special in it? Blast a hole into the floor! Trying to negotiate across a room? Be careful, because your enemies could cave the floor in beneath you! It turns what was before a \"go through this maze in THIS order\" kind of game into a \"you have this huge 3D space, use your brain to figure out how best to reach your objectives.\" It's amazing how much this expands the game! There's a two player death match mode, and 20 levels of gameplay.

It takes place in a future scenario where humans disappeared from the earth, and in their place the various animals of the city - former pets, zoo animals, and even genetic experiments - created their own ecosystem. This is certainly the game's most notable aspect. While it's easy to imagine a wildlife game set in the African savanna, where cheetahs chase after gazelles, throwing feral pets and farm animals into the mix - cats, dogs, goats, cows - gives the game a far more strange and unique feeling. The starting animal for the carnivore class, for example, is a humble Pomeranian. The game's concept is simple enough: survive. Your animal must find food (whether plant or animal), avoid larger animals, and mark territory. It doesn't have a traditional narrative per se - the main mode is simply \"survive as long as you can\", with the constant ravages of hunger and other animals wearing down your own animal over time. Gameplay-wise, Tokyo Jungle is sort of an action/stealth game. Patches of grass grow all over the ruined city, and these are useful to both predators and prey. Predators can use the grass to launch devastating strikes from concealment, which can often be enough to fell even much larger animals. Prey, on the other hand, will have to use grass to hide from predators, though it's also possible to take down predators with whatever means the creature has available (horns, hooves, etc). There are also some more \"RPG-like\" aspects - mission objectives will pop up as you play through the game, and completing them will improve your animal's strength, speed, health, and so on. Even a beagle can eventually grow strong enough to take down lions with ease. The game's unlock system is one of its more forced mechanics. Predators and prey each start with one animal type available - Pomeranians for the predators, and sika deer for the prey. Each animal has the opportunity to unlock one (rarely two) other animal type(s) by completing a mission during their playthrough. While this certainly extends the game's playtime and ensures that you play as every possible animal, it also sort of makes the game feel repetitive, especially since there just isn't that much difference gameplay-wise between most animal types. \"Story missions\" can be unlocked by playing survival mode, but these tend to be self-contained vignettes rather than part of a larger narrative (and what sort of narrative you'd get from this set-up, I don't really know). Overall, Tokyo Jungle is certainly a weird game, but not a bad one. Some people will undoubtedly find the concept interesting enough to be worth it just for that. Some may find it repetitive and dull after the initial concept introduction. Overall, though, it's surprisingly good for what it is, and is definitely a distinct addition to the PS3's library.

The other Lord of the Rings game is based on the book, and just on the FIRST book. It's VERY short and a puzzle-adventure. In comparison, The Two Towers is based on the first TWO MOVIES, NOT the books. And it is a straight button-bashing fighting game. The up side of both of these games is that they're great Aragorn-fun. The down side of both of these games is that both are WAY TOO SHORT. At least in this one you really CAN play all three characters. After the first two levels (a prologue and Weathertop) you can now choose, on each level, to be Aragorn, Gimli or Legolas. Each character has his own fighting style, from Gimli's little battle-tankness to Legolas' great double-sword action, to Aragorn's lean ranger fighting. Yes, I love Aragorn's fighting style :) This game, being based on the movie, has TONS of detail from the movie. They worked with the actual actors for the voices, and got their hands on the actual movie models for the game sets. You can see the attention to detail. There are all sorts of 'special features' where you can watch interviews with the actors and see photos from the second movie. So it's sort of like an interactive preview of Movie 2! It is SHORT thought. You can run the game through on a character in about 5 hours. Then you just run through again as the other 2. There's a secret character and level, but that's about it. There are no puzzles, no quests, it's all just bash-through-the-enemies-and-then-bash-at-the-boss. Either the boss is easy - if you find his weakness - or he is REALLY NASTY and VERY VERY FRUSTRATING. A bit of tuning needed to be done in here. And again, where the other game had at least a bit of thinking involved, this one is solely mash-mash-mash those buttons. Still, it's really great to be \"in the movie\" and hear the familiar soundtrack and voices around you. A must have for any Lord of the Rings fan - and if it's short, just spend the rest of the time trying to get a PERFECT score on every level, and watching all the videos that come with the game!</td><td>Great graphics and sound, but a button-masher</td><td>1035590400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>498111</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 25, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>0030554179</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>George Orwell had written many stories before he got to Animal farm, addressing a variety of topics. With Animal Farm, he deliberately wrote a story describing Russia's revolution and problems. At the time, during World War II, Russia was an ally of England and he couldn't find *anybody* to publish his book. Finally, he did track down someone willing to do it. The first publishing was 50,000 copies and sold for $1.75 each. As you might imagine, it didn't go over very well. However, as the Cold War progressed, and the Soviet Union became more and more an Evil Empire to the west, the book's popularity skyrocketed. Many copies were sent to Ukraine and other Soviet-controlled areas as a way to help the populace. The book got added to many school required reading lists. I have tried to do research to find if the book became a best seller (over 10 million copies sold) because of the required school reading or because of voluntary pleasure reading ... I can't seem to find anywhere which says one way or the other. My own personal feeling is that it's the school reading that got this onto the best selling list. For example, Orwell's other main book - 1984 (also on many school reading lists) was selling 750,000 copies a year in 1984. That's hefty sales for such a serious book. At only 139 pages, this is one of the shortest books on the top selling list. If you want to understand the meaning of the book, here's a quick synopsis. Old Major (Marx) has a great idea about equality and gets the farm thinking. Soon the animals (people) oust the current bad ruler (Tzar). Two main pigs lead the newly freed animals - Snowball (Trotsky, the idealistic, nice one) and Napoleon (Stalin, the greedy, mean one). Napoleon even has a bunch of cruel dogs (secret police) to keep the animals in line. The book is interesting as a very thinly veiled attack on a political system. It's important to remember it's very biased, of course! It's like reading an anti-Democrat fable written by the Republicans. In Animal Farm, the animals are all *very* stupid. The pigs are explicitly naturally smarter which is why they lead. The rest of the animals (with only specific exceptions) are very stupid. Are they saying that the entire Soviet populace were very stupid? I know many people in that region who would disagree. I suppose the story might not have had the same impact if it was more realistic (still with animals, of course). Just one example - in the real world, Ukrainians fought fiercely against Soviet rule. Stalin inflicted a famine on them, killing millions. Few animals in Animal Farm fight back - they merely mutter occasionally and are quickly silenced. Instead, the book makes a gigantic line between very innocent / dumb (all animals but the pigs) and very evil / smart (the pigs). It's a shame the book couldn't have smart-but-stuck characters as well. I suppose the dumb-but-evil animals would be the dogs, doing the bidding of the pigs. Still, I don't like the portrayal of the pigs as all naturally clever. I suppose I've made that clear :) So there's two ways I look at this book. First, during it's peak popularity with regular readers (i.e. the Cold War, the 60s) it was a propaganda tool for the West. You can consider this a really good thing in helping Ukrainians and other subjugated groups get a voice. I suppose you could consider it a interference issue since most Western countries wouldn't be happy if other countries deliberately wrote very biased, cutesy anti-current-policy books and flooded their marketplace with them :) Outside of that very specific selling time period, the longer life of this book has been with school sales. The kids reading the book don't really need to learn Russian history by understanding pigs and sheep reciting messages. Instead, by reading Animal Farm they get a *very* basic, easily understandable example of how symbols work in books. When they tackle advanced books they get very subtle symbols to understand. This is a book to get them started. The dogs act like secret police. The propaganda pig works like a propaganda machine. The book isn't subtle at all, you can see the similarities very clearly. So as a teaching tool, the book works wonderfully. It's relatively entertaining, and it's short. As far as an adult reading this in the post-2000 era, I found it interesting, but its one sidedness shone through. It's a bit like watching Barney the Dinosaur. The message is fine enough, but as a book intended for adults, even in fable form, I would have appreciated a bit more meat. Still, there are many aspects of the book which are deeply embedded into current culture, because culture assumes that every child read the book on the way towards adulthood. So from that point of view, it's a book that everyone should read at least once, to understand those references.</td><td>A great introduction to symbolism</td><td>1161734400</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>37277</td><td>4.0</td><td>43</td><td>false</td><td>10 25, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00006FXJG</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>A new Lord of the Rings RPG is out for the PS2, XBox and other platforms. How well does the first book in the trilogy translate to a role playing game? To start with, you're doing a role-playing game and start out as Frodo.

You have simple quests to achieve - get a mill working, find the pigs. You gather up some firecrackers and mushrooms (yum!) and deal with your annoying relatives. In hardly any time at all you've met up with Sam, Merry and Pippin and have left the Shire. The game progresses like that - Frodo just creeps along, solves random quests and tries to stay pure. You can use the ring to find secret areas, but using the ring makes you more corrupt. You have to do good deeds (i.e. these little quests) to keep yourself balanced. Eventually you can also play Aragorn and Gandalf, and stop into other locations such as Bree, Weathertop, Rivendell, and up through the end of the book at the river's edge. I was disappointed because the back of the game made it sound as if you could *be* any of the three characters (Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf). Instead you're stuck as Frodo in the beginning, trudging around from house to house. Most houses don't even have anyone in them and the few that do are often empty. The puzzles are solved in about 2 minutes each with little thought. I do enjoy the graphics, and the way each character is a 'type' is fun. Frodo's purity and thieving skills, Aragorn's fighting, Gandalf's magic. The cut scenes are good and help to move the story along, and flow in with what you are doing. Still, I really would have enjoyed something a bit more involved, with quests that involved more actual thought, with real thieving being necessary instead of just 'pick lock - ok got deed' and 'sneak along road -ok got past riders'. The quests are very obvious - you get 2 or 3 explicit clues for each one that push you into the right direction. The voice actors sometimes seem bored with what is a world-rescuing epic. Gandalf's recitation of the 'one ring to rule them all' at the beginning sounds like he's reading through a shopping list!

However, the game defies all expectations in how poorly it is executed. The only thing relevant to the game that you need to know about Bleach is that there are ghost samurai called \"Soul Reapers\" who have unique swords with different powers. Sounds like a great basis for a fighting game, right? Well, \"Shattered Blade\" seems to somehow mess up the simple fighting game formula with a poor concept and poorer handling. The game is a \"3d\" fighting game - the two fighters can circle around each other to dodge attacks. Attacks are divided into three varieties - slash (horizontal slash), chop (vertical slash), and stab (forward attack). These are done by moving the Wii remote in the appropriate manner to imitate such an attack. The attack types work on a rock-paper-scissors hierarchy: chop beats slash, slash beats stab, and stab beats chop. So, basically, if you interrupt a chop attack with a stab attack, the stab attack will go through. There's also a little minigame that can occur if two swords clash where both fighters go through five rounds of \"rock paper scissors\" with each other. The more rounds you win, the more damage you'll do once it's over. There are three kinds of attacks. Regular attacks are done by simply waving the Wii remote with no buttons pressed - these are very fast but do little damage, and their purpose is to weather down an enemy for a critical attack. Critical attacks are stronger, slower melee attacks that are done by combining a Wii remote movement with holding down the A button. Critical attacks change depending on the character, but are not particularly personalized. Special Attacks are the final type of attack, and are done by holding B while moving the Wii remote. These tend to be more personalized based on the character - projectile attacks and special abilities fall within this category. Each character also has a powered-up mode, achieved by charging (shaking the Wii nunchuck) or by taking damage, both of which fill a gauge. Once the gauge is full, the character enters their higher-level state. This involves a cutscene that lasts about 5 to 7 seconds and cannot be skipped; in a 60-second battle, this is kind of an annoyance. Some characters simply get stronger with their powered-up state, while others change more drastically in their attack patterns. For example, Kenpachi Zaraki simply strengthens his attacks, while Toshiro Hitsugaya summons a giant ice creature to augment his techniques, and Renji Abarai turns his sword into a giant segmented snake that attacks his enemies. The variety of characters in the game is probably its strongest point, though this is due more to the series it was based on rather than the game itself. Each character has unique abilities; there are plenty of regular sword-swinging characters, but some also have unique twists like extending weapons, a bow (can only use ranged attacks), and one character whose blade heals his enemies, so he's forced to use his special attacks only (which don't use the sword) until he reaches his powered-up form, at which point he does massive amounts of damage (until it expires). The special attacks and powered-up forms are the primary things that separate the characters, though the fact that each character only has one or two special abilities at most in the series somewhat limits how unique they can be. There are 28 characters in the game (over half need to be unlocked by playing through story modes), each with their own fairly unique playing style. There are some extras included in the game, as well, though the selection is rather poor. You can buy character models and set them as the main menu guide (who just stands in the background and lists off the main menu choices as you select them), or you can buy new costumes for your characters. However, there aren't any real NEW costumes created for the game - rather, they're just costumes that were in the series for short periods of time, like the school uniforms that some of the characters wore when visiting the \"real world\". The problem with the game, control-wise, is just how poorly the whole \"rock paper scissors\" thing works. Regular attacks do next to no damage, so basically you're just trying to set up for a critical or special attack, which vary wildly depending on the characters. Characters with longer reaches, and particularly characters with extending weapons (Renji Abarai and Ikkaku Madarame) have huge, unbalanced advantages - they can swing their weapons with huge ranges with next-to-no penalty for doing so. The game is basically a button-masher in its purest form, except instead of mashing buttons you're waving a Wii remote hoping that whatever you're doing is the right type of attack to counter the enemy's. Just because of how random everything feels, the game is incredibly unfun and frustrating to play. The graphics in this game aren't great. It's obvious they tried to go for an anime style, with lots of japanese sound effects and speed lines, but overall the game looks like it belongs on a PS2 or Gamecube rather than a current generation console. Plus, with the speed of movement in-game, it's hard to even see the effects, anyways. One particular annoyance is that, in story mode, there are cutscenes at the beginning and end. However, these \"cutscenes\" are actually just a single still image with character voiceovers. The sound isn't great, either. The music is lackluster and forgettable, and the voice acting doesn't sync up particularly well. I have no problem with the English dub, but the way it's been put together with the visuals is pretty poor. It feels really awkward and clunky. It's difficult to convey how little fun Shattered Blade is to play. Even for a fan of the series, it's a complete exercise in frustration. The controls are so wonky (especially the movement controls, which allow you to go forwards and backwards or side to side, but not both at the same time, meaning you have to run in a zig-zag pattern and avoid the invisible walls around the arena) that the entire game is just completely unenjoyable. 3/10.</td><td>Complete Exercise in Frustration</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>115310</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000UC5ML0</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The first Ratchet and Clank game on the PS3, \"Tools of Destruction\" keeps true to Ratchet and Clanks' roots in a lot of ways. Fans of the series will enjoy more madcap action that previous games have delivered, buffed up with improved graphics and physics courtesy of the PS3. The gameplay handles well, and hasn't changed from previous Ratchet and Clank games in any significant ways. The normal gameplay is third-person action platforming, using a wide variety of weapons. The weapons differ from traditional action games - there's no standard \"machine guns\" or \"shotguns\" or \"rocket launchers\"; instead, weapons include things like \"electro-whips\", \"tornado summoner\", and \"plasma-beast dispenser\". Even the basic \"shoot at enemies\" weapon is still somewhat unusual - it's like a machine gun, but it's not as fast, and it shoots fire that bounces when it hits enemies. The weapons are fun to use, and even the standard weapons are still enjoyable after a while. The weapons can be upgraded in two ways - either automatically through use, or more specifically by spending \"Raritanium\" (an element acquired in certain special areas) on upgrades. Upgrades made with Raritanium follow a pattern - like the Sphere Grid in FFX, you must buy some upgrades to unlock upgrades further along. These upgrades range from damage to range to firing speed to the amount of bolts (currency) generated by defeated enemies with that weapon. Each weapon also has a different path of upgrades to follow, as well. Besides weapons, the other category of usable items are \"devices\" - more expensive items usable for only one use per purchase that can't be replenished by finding ammo around the stages. These devices have more spectacular effects than regular weapons, ranging from confusing enemies to leeching health from enemies to stunning enemies in a large radius. They are more \"support items\" than actual weapons, but can help out in a tough situation. There is also a wide range of inventory items like jetpacks and magnetic boots, but these tend to be more passive and automatic, simply augmenting your normal movement commands (instead of having to switch them in and out). Weapons are aimed either by shooting while looking in a direction, or an over-the-shoulder mode for more accurate aiming. Other than the normal gameplay, there are also some different segments as well. In some parts, there's rail-grinding sequences, or sequences where you're falling from a great height and must avoid traffic or missiles by moving the Sixaxis controller around. These segments occur reasonably rarely and are short enough that they're fun without being laborious or repetitive. As a whole, the game is very smooth and intuitive, though some of the maneuvers aren't explained very well, despite the pop-up tutorials - in my own case, I didn't trigger the pop-up tutorial for long jumping until I had figured it out myself and was about to do it, despite having unsuccessfully jumped over the same ledge five or six times while trying to figure it out. However, once you figure it out, the game is fun and enjoyable to play. The graphics are well done, maintaining an over-the-top cartoonish style without being burdened by effects like cel-shading or the overusage of lighting and bloom. Everything is crisp and viewing is easy on the eyes, unlike a lot of PS3 games where due to the lighting and reflections it actually becomes hard to see in many circumstances. The animation is smooth and I didn't experience any slowdown even with a huge number of objects on the screen. The sound is about average - it's all right to listen to, but nothing really stood out in terms of music or voice acting. Overall, the game is fun and enjoyable. Fans of the series will find more of the stuff they liked - platforming and destruction, with no fancy add-ons or series-breaking additions. The only real problem is that it's all the same as every other R+C game, but in this case it works for the better. 8/10.</td><td>Fun and Enjoyable</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>121576</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000X25GW2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>A game made by Suda 51, the game maker behind the cel-shaded rail shooter Killer 7, No More Heroes reflects its creator's desire to push boundaries and innovate as much as possible. However, does that mean it stacks up as a game by itself? In No More Heroes, the player takes the role of Travis Touchdown, a 27-year-old fanboy living in a small apartment in California. After obtaining a Beam Katana - essentially a lightsaber - by winning an online auction, Travis decides to become the #1 ranked assassin in the world. The game is divided into two types: Trying to move up the ranks from #11 to #1 by challenging the ranked assassins above you, or working to get enough money to enter an official petition to go after the next assassin. The assassin challenges are the combat segments. You run through an area fighting various low-level goons before reaching the boss - the ranked assassin. Travis' beam katana is the main weapon in combat. It is swung with the A button, but will strike differently depending on if it is in high stance (the Wii remote held straight up) or low stance (the Wii remote held to the side). The beam saber can also be charged up for a larger attack. Enemies who are injured enough are \"finished off\" by waving the Wii remote in the direction indicated on the screen for a final, bisecting slash. The beam saber has a short battery that is drained by attacking and guarding, and drained even more by a charge attack. Once the battery is dead, neither attacking nor guarding is possible with the beam saber. To charge the battery back up, the Wii remote has to be shaken up and down to \"get the juices flowing again\". Besides his saber, Travis also has an array of unarmed attacks, including punches, kicks, and throws, that can be done without draining the sword's battery. The fighting in the game is fun and decent, with some innovative uses of the Wii remote - it really feels like they're trying to make the Wii remote a part of the fighting and not just a gimmick. However, in terms of gameplay, it's overshadowed by more pure-action games like Ninja Gaiden. On its own, though, it's reasonably fun. The money-gathering parts of the game are significantly less fun. Later in the game, Travis can use his reputation as an assassin to take assassination jobs (which are combat segments), but for the early parts of the game Travis will have to take regular part-time jobs. Everything from mowing lawns to collecting garbage to sweeping for mines is included in this part. They're essentially mini-games; there's only a few of them (nine total), but you have to keep doing them to earn more and more money. They're kind of a drag to do over and over, and really, if you can just do a repetitive activity like this in a game, you might as well do it in real life and earn some real money. Of course, it doesn't seem like it was meant to be fun, anyways. Besides submitting challenges, it's also possible to buy various new items with your money. Travis' entire wardrobe is customizable with new clothing, and in addition he can buy new beam swords to increase his performance. Travis' apartment is the main base of the game; Travis can change options and equipment, as well as simply sit back and enjoy himself by watching tv or playing with his pet cat. The graphics are a neat cel-shaded style, with lots of blood, but in technical terms it doesn't look great. It looks, to be honest, like a Gamecube game more than anything else. Furthermore, the lighting isn't very good, and shadows tend to obscure way more than they should, so it's hard to see things. Overall, it looks really dated, and this tends to detract from the action sequences. The sound is pretty good in voice acting terms but not great music-wise. Overall, No More Heroes has some interesting ideas, but the creators' desires to push boundaries ultimately causes the game to be less fun overall. It seems more like an experiment than a real game, and despite some neat innovations with the Wii remote (including some parts where the remote is held to the player's ear and used as a radio), it's really not that fun of a game.</td><td>Interesting Ideas but Issues</td><td>1224547200</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>125033</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000ZK696O</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The successor to the Ninja Gaiden game for the Xbox, Ninja Gaiden 2 is one of those rare sequels that seems to improve on everything done by the first game while adding worthwhile new features, enemies, and levels. The basic gameplay is the same as the first Ninja Gaiden game, featuring fast-and-frantic swordplay and various ninja abilities to supplement it. You play as Ryu Hayabusa, last ninja of the Dragon Clan lineage, and your mission is to seal the ancient Arch-Fiends away before they destroy the world. The action is almost non-stop in NG2; Ryu has a wide array of acrobatic actions at his disposal to aid in his swordplay. There are fast and slow attacks that can be linked as a combo for different effects, and there's a lot of leaping and diving to throw into the mix as well. In addition to melee weapons like a sword, a staff, claws, and a scythe, Ryu also has a few ranged weapons as well - shurikens (regular and exploding) and a bow. Finally, Ryu has certain magical abilities like fireballs and cutting winds to attack his enemies with, though their use is limited. His enemies range from ninjas - armed with equipment similar to Ryu's - to demons, large and small. The gameplay is smooth, but fast and unforgiving. Your enemies attack ferociously and without mercy - no fair-play \"one on one\" duels here, your enemies will be doing their absolute utmost to make Ryu die. Human enemies (the ninja) have a wide variety of \"abilities\", for lack of a better word, that differentiate them from other random grunts in other games. The ninjas in Ninja Gaiden can lose limbs (arms or legs) and keep fighting - and this will happen a lot, be assured. Heavily injured enemies will try to grab on to Ryu and detonate their bomb as a last-ditch suicide attempt. Ninja types range from melee combatants with swords and claws to ranged types with bows and magic spells. Even without these skills, it's hard to keep up with their attacks, which require dodging, guarding, evading, and counterattacking to deal with - you can't just wade in and mash the attack buttons and expect to survive. The demons are even harder, being less predictable, depending on their type. Some are small, bat-like creatures that swarm Ryu faster than he can swing his sword, while others are hulking colossi that can grab Ryu and squeeze the life out of his body. There are bosses on every level as well - these enemies are generally much larger than any regular enemy, and their strength makes guarding useless, forcing Ryu to jump and dive for his life. Furthermore, they're not fazed by your attacks, requiring you to time your attacks so that you'll have time to escape before they counterattack. Overall, Ninja Gaiden is a relatively simple game in that it keeps the same basic premise for combat; there aren't really any segments that deviate from the established gameplay. As a whole, the controls are good and also notably responsive. In some other games, you have to adjust your timing to the game and pause between pressing buttons so that the moves you've inputted can be executed. In NG2, the game moves roughly about as fast as you push buttons - if you're smashing the buttons really quickly, then the moves will get executed really quickly. To give an example, Ryu has the ability to walljump between two adjacent parallel walls. At first I thought I had to adjust my timing to wait for when he landed; I quickly realized that I could just mash the A button and ascend as quickly as I tapped. The game really rewards you for having good reflexes, and tries not to hinder you as best it can. The only really annoying parts about the controls are the camera (which is kind of unresponsive at times) and sensitivity with regards to hanging on pipes and running on walls, both of which have to do with the camera (since running on a wall is \"running forward\", if the camera changes it can mess you up mid-run). The graphics in the game are really good looking, though \"realistic\" isn't quite the word that I'd use to describe them. They're clearly fake, but it's on purpose, so even though the characters have flawless, one-tone skin with no wrinkles or anything, it looks good and like it was done on purpose. The in-game graphics are really good, too. Combat is quick and highly cinematic without distracting or detracting from the gameplay experience. The most notable detail is the bodies, which are persistent - kill a bunch of ninjas, and their bodies don't fade (not while onscreen, at least). Furthermore, I never thought I'd think of blood and severed limbs as being \"artistic\", but this game really has the prettiest blood sprays and dead bodies that I can think of. Blood splatters on walls depending on the angle that you cut, and you really get the feeling with this game that you're an absolute ninja murder-machine. One of the more impressive details is the blood that accumulates on your blade - when a fight is over and Ryu stands idle for a few seconds, he whips the blood off the blade (throwing an extra splatter onto the floor) and re-sheathes it. The sound in the game isn't particularly notable, except that the sounds of combat are really well shown - the clangs and screams, in addition with the music, create a mood-setting level of background noises that keep you in the action. The music in general doesn't have any tracks that are particularly good, though. As a whole, Ninja Gaiden 2 is a really fun game to play - one of the first games in a while that really feels like a game and not just an interactive story. Flimsy demon-based story aside, Ninja Gaiden 2 is really just an excuse to kill a bunch of ninjas and demons with fancy moves and look really awesome while doing it. The only real problem is that the game is so hard that it might be intimidating to casual players, but for players with good reflexes and a strong will Ninja Gaiden 2 offers nothing but good, fun gameplay. 9/10</td><td>Fun Fast Furious</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>125838</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000ZK7ZMQ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Soul Calibur, in its heyday, was one of the most respected fighting series.  However, after Soul Calibur II, the series seems to have lost its way and lost focus. Soul Calibur IV is in many ways a victim of that lost focus. The core mechanics remain roughly the same. Each character has a different weapon, ranging from axes to swords to staves. Each character has different moves that are based on a combination of vertical and horizontal-based attacks. There's also a system of parrying and dodging, as well as traditional guarding. In previous games, the system was fun and balanced, allowing for fast-paced but highly technical fights. However, in Soul Calibur IV, while the basic system has been carried over, in a lot of places it feels much less technical and much more like \"hit them with the same attacks that you know work\". One specific example of this is Mitsurugi's standard one-two vertical combo, which hits fast enough that if you catch someone in it, they won't be able to counter with any move because it hits so fast that it interrupts any move they try. I have literally been part of a battle online that consisted of my opponent and me (both Mitsurugi) either attacking with that move or guarding against it and hoping for a lucky parry so that it would be our turn to attack with that move. It's also possible to get a \"Ring Out\" by knocking the enemy out of the arena, but in SC4 this option feels really cheap - what's supposed to be a detailed swordfight quickly becomes \"who can throw the opponent out first\" due to SC4's poorly handled physics. In one team match, I won consecutive battles by simply standing near the edge and using the same throw any time a new challenger appeared on screen. The major new game mechanic introduced for SC4 is the \"Critical Finish\" mode. Both fighters in a match have a \"soul gauge\" that increases when they hit their opponent and decreases when they guard against enemy attacks. When a character's soul gauge decreases enough, they go through a \"soul crush\", which is a short window for the other player to perform a Critical Finish. The Critical Finish is an instant-kill attack; however, the shortness of the life bars and the rarity of finding someone who guards enough to actually lose their soul gauge means that it's not an over-spammed attack that gets used all the time, but rather a way to finish off a long and difficult battle with a tide-turning attack. In most cases, it's usually easier to just kill an opponent than to try to hit them while they guard enough times to cause them to lose their soul gauge. In addition to the Critical Finish, the other new game mechanic is breakable armor. Each character has three \"segments\" - high, middle, and low. Repeated attacks to an area will break off the upper layer of armor on that area (leaving undergarments intact, of course) and make that area more vulnerable. It doesn't really add much to the game, and as a game mechanic feels kind of useless. There are a few new characters in the game. Hilde is the only real \"new\" Soul Calibur character; she's a female knight with a neat fighting style that uses both a sword and a spear, and she's fun to play as. Raphael's adopted daughter Amy returns from SC3, where she was a guest character; she uses a style similar to the Rapier style from SC3. There are also 2 guest characters from Star Wars in each game - both game modes have The Apprentice from the upcoming \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\", the PS3 version has Darth Vader, and the XBOX 360 version has Master Yoda. Vader and Yoda are both decent characters, but The Apprentice is ridiculously overpowered, possessing one of the highest speeds in the game as well as high damage and force powers. When encountered in arcade mode, he is far more difficult to defeat than any other character in the game, and it's even worse when someone picks him in online mode. Finally, there are five characters guest-designed by prominent Japanese artists. None of these have a unique style; each simply takes the style of an established character and uses their own unique weapons. These include a dual-sword Samurai woman, a club-wielding ogre girl, and a bizarre moon person. None of them are particularly well-designed, though, and they're not even that fun to play. They don't even have the unique styles of the Star Wars characters to make up for it. All in all, the new characters for this game, other than Hilde, feel like wastes of time and space. There are a couple different modes for single-player. The basic story mode consists of going through five fights against various opponents. The new mode used in most of SC4's single player game types is a tag-team mode, where if you have multiple characters on your team, you can swap them out in the middle of a battle and let the swapped-out character regenerate health. In story mode, you're usually fighting teams of 3 enemies, and depending on the character you play as, you may get allies of your own. The story mode is much shorter due to the fact that there are multiple enemies in each fight. In addition to story mode, there's also a more traditional arcade mode where you fight eight single enemies in a row; this more resembles the single-player mode of previous Soul Calibur games. The other new single-player mode is the Tower of Lost Souls. This is a mode where you go through floors of a tower, two or three at a time. Each set of floors has a different \"gimmick\" and a different boss; for example, one set of floors has a \"clown\" or \"harlequin\" gimmick, while another has a \"knight\" gimmick. There is a secret goal on each floor that is hinted at when you start the floor; completing this objective unlocks a new piece of clothing for use in creating characters. The multiplayer modes in this game took the largest hit. In previous SC games, there were a wide variety of match styles and gameplay styles that could be used for multiplayer. In SC4, the two styles are limited to a regular match, with or without bonuses provided by equipping different weapons and items. The team-based system used for single player does not get used for multiplayer, despite its prominence in the single-player mode. The new addition for multiplayer is online mode, which functions the same as regular versus mode in that it only has two modes. The online mechanics are, at least, smooth and relatively problem-free, if a bit simple. There are levels in online play, but unlike games like Halo 3 and Metal Gear Online, it's not an average of how good a player you are, but rather a tally of how many times you've won (like an RPG). It's possible to look for a player within your level range, but it doesn't really matter that much, since levels have nothing to do with ability. The game plays smoothly if your connection is four or five bars, but starts to lag insufferably at 3 bars and lower. Create-a-Character is in many ways the heart of this game's unlockable content. Creating a character has been simplified and improved in many ways. The unique Create-a-Character styles from SC3 have been removed, so every CaC now uses a regular fighter's style (however, you don't have to go unlocking styles like you did in SC3, either). Another addition in creating a character is physique customization. It's possible to determine how muscular a character is and how much physique they have. For men, a high physique means that they are bulky and wide-chested, while a low physique means they are thin and scrawny. For women, a high physique means that they are busty and curvy, and a low physique means that they are thin and flat. The difference between the extremes is clear and easy to see (something that's fairly rare for this type of \"sliding bar adjustment\"), and it's neat that they let you change it. There's a variety of faces and voices, but it seems like there's too many \"extremes\" (really young faces and voices, really old faces and voices) and not enough average stuff. There's 8 faces for males and 8 for females, but two of each are really young and two of each are really old, which really means there's 4 average faces for males and 4 average faces for females. The same goes for voices, as well, except that the personalities of each voice are also very different. The hairstyles, at least, are relatively diverse and cover a wide range of styles, short and long. Supposedly, there's an alignment system in SC4 that changes how good/evil your character is (or, at least, there's different endings in story mode where a custom character will either claim Soul Calibur, Soul Edge, or both, depending on his or her alignment), but unlike SC3 it's not visible, and the voices don't change either. I had a character who had a kindly voice and only said kind things, but who still claimed Soul Edge (the evil sword) in the end. The clothes for Create a Character deserve special mention. The only nice-looking clothes in the game is the armor, which is all intricately designed and looks really fantastic. However, a lot of basic clothes that would make sense in the game - for example, a set of tights that covers the whole body, so that the armor isn't just sitting on bare skin - aren't actually in the game. It seems like the costume creators spread themselves too thin; while there's only a few armor sets for female characters, there are at least four uniforms that are just there to be goofy - a maid uniform, a waitress uniform, a stewardess uniform, and a nurse uniform. None of these make sense in the game's context; they're just there so you can play dress-up. Furthermore, there are only two ways to unlock new clothes - either by going through the Tower of Souls (and unlocking only a single piece of clothing per floor) or by getting \"honors\", SCIV's version of achievements, which range from simple tasks like \"beat story mode\" to more complex ones like \"land 10,000 total attacks on an opponent\". In SC3, it was enough to go through the strategy-like sub-mode to unlock new clothes; in SC4, it feels a lot more limited, and since Create-a-Character is one of the most emphasized modes in the game, it feels really unusual. Customizing a character also adds stat bonuses and skills. For this reason, you can customize regular characters with Create-a-Character, too. You can either add items and change weapons for their default costumes (to give them stat increases) or you can give them their own costume made up from Create-a-Character parts, though for whatever reason you can't use their \"normal\" hairstyle and have to use their 2P hairstyle (or any of the other create-a-character hairstyles) if you want to customize them. Different clothes in the game provide different bonuses, either to stats (attack, defense, and health) or to skill points. Skill points are used to assign skills of various categories, ranging from things like \"automatic guard impact\" or \"automatic unblockable attack\" that will randomly aid you in battle, to \"health drain\" that sucks health out of enemies and gives it to you, to skills that increase your stats when fighting enemies of a certain gender or alignment. The skills and stats are kind of neat, but they also affect the character-creation process, when you feel like you have to buy stuff that gives good stats, instead of just getting stuff that looks neat. Thankfully, in versus mode (regular and online) there is an option to play the game without any stat modifiers or skills, which means that you can just have fights between characters without worrying about that stuff. The graphics in this game are really good - as mentioned, the armor in particular looks really nice. The costumes for the main characters have gotten a bit more ridiculous in most cases, but the new character, Hilde, has a really neat set of armor, and the create-a-character option allow for a lot of good armor choices as well. While the other clothes look okay, only the armor and the weapons really show off the game's graphics, with their reflective properties and intricate detailing. The game's backgrounds are pretty good, as well, but nothing particularly noteworthy or epic like some of the stages from SC2 and SC3. The audio is decent, but there's nothing really worth pointing out in terms of music or voicing. As a whole, Soul Calibur 4 is a disappointment that can be fun, but for the most part isn't. SC4 took all the complaints about SC3 and made them worse, and lost most of the things that made the series fun in SC1 and SC2. A lot of the systems and gameplay modes are really poorly handled. The only really fun thing in the game is messing with create-a-character, but despite the physique customization options, the incredibly limited number of faces, voices, and clothing sets kind of puts a damper on the whole experience. Really, it feels like SC4 is trying to do too many things at once, and isn't accomplishing any of them. If the game consisted wholly of a more fleshed-out character maker and a multiplayer game with some more game types, it might be better. As it is, though, Soul Calibur 4 only deserves a 7/10.</td><td>Should be More Fleshed Out</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>128312</td><td>3.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00113JSCG</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Despite being a successor to the early 90s horror series Alone in the Dark, the new Alone in the Dark game is only partially related to those old games. It has its own merits, and its own shortcomings, but does not seem particularly related to previous games and must be considered more as a stand-alone game. The story of the game involves a doomsday cult trying to summon an ancient evil using Edward Carnby, the private detective and protagonist from Alone in the Dark (the original), who has been brought to the present by unknown means and has amnesia. At first, the evil presence (marked by glowing cracks in walls that move and seek out prey as if alive) is limited to a single building, but it quickly spreads throughout the entirety of New York City, leaving Edward trapped in Central Park. As far as stories go, this is a decent one for a survival horror game, and there are a lot of good scares and surprises. In the beginning, you're trapped in a building where the very walls are trying to get you, and in addition you're also dealing with zombies - people swallowed up by the cracks brought back as malicious outlets for the main demon to speak and act through. The main demon's voice is kind of bad, though - it's the same deep monster voice that has basically become a cliche in movies about demons, and it makes the glowing cracks go from \"unidentified, unintelligent, but malicious entity\" to \"scary-voiced demon guy\". In fact, as far as scares go, the main problem with Alone in the Dark is that you're so rarely alone. Besides the short-lived survivors you encounter throughout the game, you also have a sidekick, Sarah, who comes and goes throughout parts of the game. Well, \"sidekick\" is a bit generous, since there's not a lot of cooperative gameplay involved. But the point is that there's no feeling of isolation; it's more like a disaster movie that happens to have monsters in it. The standard gameplay is a fairly regular survival-horror control system. The game is normally played in third-person, with somewhat awkward tank-style controls (IE you have to walk, then turn, then walk, rather then just turning while you walk). The camera in particular is hard to manage, and trying to look around while moving or anything besides walking in a straight line was pretty difficult to manage. Aiming firearms is done exclusively in first-person, but melee combat has a bit of a unique twist to it - it's done in third person like normal gameplay segments, and swinging melee weapons is done by \"swinging\" the right thumbstick from one direction to another. This works pretty well in most cases, and it changes depending on the weapon being used. For example, with long weapons like 2x4s or swords, you only have the option to swing horizontally or vertically. However, with heavier items like fire extinguishers, you can also use the item as a battering ram to smash down doors. Most of the enemies in the game can only be temporarily defeated by weapons, and must be consumed by fire to be fully destroyed. To this end, innovating ways to use fire as a weapon is one of the most important parts of the game. The most basic form of this is to light a melee weapon on fire by sticking it into the flames; the flames don't last forever, but they're an instant-kill to most of the monsters that you'll face, and the enemy cowers and flees accordingly. In fact, I would say that swinging a burning 2x4 while your formerly aggressive zombie enemies cower and flee before you is probably the most satisfying part of the game. There are other methods as well that must be thought up with more open thinking - things like molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers made out of a can of hair spray and a match. While the \"make weapons out of things to defeat your foes\" aspect is pretty much limited to fire, the fact that fire is what destroys your enemies makes it at least plausible. Your inventory in the game is represented by the holsters and pouches in your jacket. The left side of your jacket is used for small items like boxes of ammo or batteries, there's a holster for a gun and a flashlight on your chest, and the right side is used for bottles and cans of various types. The fact that there's a legitimate, actual inventory (you actually look down in first-person to access it, and it's in real-time too so you have to hurry and put stuff together instead of just calmly making a molotov cocktail during a pause) helps with the atmosphere that's being created. In a similar manner, wounds show up on your body and must be healed with either bandages or a first-aid spray. There's no health bar (as with the inventory, all HUD elements are minimal in this game), but you can get a general idea of how injured you are by the status of your wounds (which are still present after being healed, but aren't red and open). You also get a phone/PDA at a point in the game that allows you to make calls and gives you access to a GPS map of the area you are in. In many situations it's necessary to hotwire a car or activate a fusebox (which is done in real time, often with monsters closing in on you) by picking the right wires to spark together. You're often frantically pressing wires together hoping that they're the right ones but doing it quickly enough to get away from the monsters closing in on your car. This is a pretty good part of the game in an atmospheric sense. Driving the car is another thing, though; the controls are wonky and in most cases the demands of the game as far as getting away from giant apocalyptic cracks in the road are a little bit over-the-top. I spent a good hour on what is really a five-minute segment where you're trying to get away from a giant series of cracking roads and earthquakes because the car didn't turn enough, or it turned too much, or I hit another motorist and the car got stuck, or I hit something at a bad angle. The last one in particular is annoying; at the end of the sequence in question, you're supposed to go flying out through a window in a building, but the first time I got there, I assumed that was what was supposed to happen, but I hit it at an odd angle and I didn't go through (I left a mark on the glass though). The next two times I made it there, I tried looking around for other exits but got blocked off. Only on the last time did I realize what had happened and just drive straight into the glass. The graphics in the game are pretty good; the best graphics are the fire graphics, which flicker and dance pretty realistically, while the worst are probably the wounds that Edward receives on his body. The idea's neat, but in actuality they're just the same image copy-pasted onto different parts of his body. The \"slash that ripped through cloth and pierced the skin\" image looks okay when it's on his pants or shirt, but when it's on his jacket it just looks like someone slapped it on like a sticker. Also, you get the same kind of wound no matter how you got the injury. Overall, though, the graphics are decent and atmospheric. The sound isn't bad, but the music just feels wrong. It's a nice attempt at atmospheric music, but most of the time it's not so much \"scary\" as it is \"epic\", with giant sweeping musical interludes and ominous chanting that fits more with \"Carmina Burana\" than a horror movie. It just feels overstated, and not particularly scary. Furthermore, it gets old pretty quickly, too. As a whole, the worst part of Alone in the Dark is its execution. It has a lot of good ideas, and most of the elements taken by themselves are pretty sound. However, the actual execution of the ideas - the controls, the situation, the atmosphere - are all really terrible and frustrating, and the game seems more like a battle against the game itself than against any monsters or puzzles. The interactive environments seem more linear than natural; despite the fact that it's supposed to be stuff that's done in a manner that makes it seem \"realistic\", there's so many scripted sequences that it's hard to get into it. As a whole, Alone in the Dark deserves a 6/10 - good ideas, but poor execution.</td><td>Good Ideas - Poor Execution</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>144804</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000X25GW2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>A game made by Suda 51, the game maker behind the cel-shaded rail shooter Killer 7, No More Heroes reflects its creator's desire to push boundaries and innovate as much as possible. However, does that mean it stacks up as a game by itself? In No More Heroes, the player takes the role of Travis Touchdown, a 27-year-old fanboy living in a small apartment in California. After obtaining a Beam Katana - essentially a lightsaber - by winning an online auction, Travis decides to become the #1 ranked assassin in the world. The game is divided into two types: Trying to move up the ranks from #11 to #1 by challenging the ranked assassins above you, or working to get enough money to enter an official petition to go after the next assassin. The assassin challenges are the combat segments. You run through an area fighting various low-level goons before reaching the boss - the ranked assassin. Travis' beam katana is the main weapon in combat. It is swung with the A button, but will strike differently depending on if it is in high stance (the Wii remote held straight up) or low stance (the Wii remote held to the side). The beam saber can also be charged up for a larger attack. Enemies who are injured enough are \"finished off\" by waving the Wii remote in the direction indicated on the screen for a final, bisecting slash. The beam saber has a short battery that is drained by attacking and guarding, and drained even more by a charge attack. Once the battery is dead, neither attacking nor guarding is possible with the beam saber. To charge the battery back up, the Wii remote has to be shaken up and down to \"get the juices flowing again\". Besides his saber, Travis also has an array of unarmed attacks, including punches, kicks, and throws, that can be done without draining the sword's battery. The fighting in the game is fun and decent, with some innovative uses of the Wii remote - it really feels like they're trying to make the Wii remote a part of the fighting and not just a gimmick. However, in terms of gameplay, it's overshadowed by more pure-action games like Ninja Gaiden. On its own, though, it's reasonably fun. The money-gathering parts of the game are significantly less fun. Later in the game, Travis can use his reputation as an assassin to take assassination jobs (which are combat segments), but for the early parts of the game Travis will have to take regular part-time jobs. Everything from mowing lawns to collecting garbage to sweeping for mines is included in this part. They're essentially mini-games; there's only a few of them (nine total), but you have to keep doing them to earn more and more money. They're kind of a drag to do over and over, and really, if you can just do a repetitive activity like this in a game, you might as well do it in real life and earn some real money. Of course, it doesn't seem like it was meant to be fun, anyways. Besides submitting challenges, it's also possible to buy various new items with your money. Travis' entire wardrobe is customizable with new clothing, and in addition he can buy new beam swords to increase his performance. Travis' apartment is the main base of the game; Travis can change options and equipment, as well as simply sit back and enjoy himself by watching tv or playing with his pet cat.

The basic gameplay is based on planets and their gravity well; each planet acts as a \"base\" of sorts that can be upgraded on the planet itself with infrastructure improvements or reinforced with structures built in orbit like defense platforms and construction facilities. Each planet has a gravity well where ships can move around and engage in combat; traveling between planets causes ships to automatically enter faster-than-light speed once they're out of the planet's gravity well. There isn't a lot of specific customization you can do on planets (all building construction takes place in orbit), but there are important things you can do on them nonetheless. Improving the infrastructure of the planet increases the amount of taxes that you get from that planet, and also the loyalty of the planet's citizens. It's also possible to explore the planet to look for resources or artifacts hidden on it. The structures that can be built in orbit range from defense platforms to mining outposts to ship construction yards to trade posts to research stations. Defense platforms, like gauss or missile launchers, have a certain radius and are placed around your planet; due to the size of the gravity well around the planet, you have to consider which trade lanes the enemies will come from when placing your platforms. Mining outposts harvest two of the three resources in the game - metal and crystal (the third being credits, gained by taxation) - from asteroids around the planet. Construction yards are your basic unit-building stations, and can build whatever you've researched. Trade posts generate credits depending on how many of your planets are linked up with them. Finally, research stations (either civic or military) affect how much research you can do - the more stations you have, the more advanced your research can get. Research has four types - civilian (affects planets and buildings), military (affects units that can be created and bonuses they receive), fleet (affects experience and maximum amounts of ships), and artifact (grants special bonuses if you receive alien artifacts). Combat in the game is two-dimensional, and doesn't take advantage of the \"space\" concept like Homeworld did, which is a major disappointment. Rather than a strategy game, the combat feels more like an assortment of numbers stacking up against each other. Ships can't maneuver particularly well, so in most cases the battle strategy consists of lines of ships shooting at each other. The only real thing you can try to do is maneuver toward your planetary defenses so that they'll be shooting your enemies as well. The only real thing that makes this acceptable is the intended size of battles and the number of battles that can be going on simultaneously once your empire expands. It's easy to keep track of ships due to the sidebar interface that shows all ships (friendly and enemy) near a given planet, and furthermore if you zoom out enough, all the ships show up as icons that allow for easy real-time management. In short, this is a strategy game, but more on an indirect scale of numbers vs numbers, rather than a direct tactical level. The variety of units in the game - from small corvettes to long-range missile frigates to gargantuan dreadnoughts - keeps things interesting, but in the end it all comes down to numbers. Besides ship-to-ship fighting, the other part of galactic conquest is taking planets. This is done by nuking the planet from orbit with either capital ships or specially-made siege frigates. As missiles fall on the planet, its infrastructure decreases; when it's down fully, it can be captured. Depending on the planet's loyalty to its previous owner, it might be difficult for the new planet to adapt to your empire, and rebellion is entirely possible if the planet's inhabitants are mistreated. The other, more peaceful way of getting new planets is to colonize an uninhabited planet. The colonized planet is generally much more loyal than a conquered planet, though the infrastructure and upgrades start at their base levels. Diplomacy also plays a key factor in the game; when playing against AI opponents, you will often be given missions that can raise your standing with them, making them more likely to agree to a ceasefire or an alliance. It's also possible to put bounties on the heads of players - rewards and incentives for other players to attack them, essentially. Finally, you can hire pirates to raid certain planets and upset your enemy with no cost in terms of your own ships. The graphics are decent, but minimal - the details are good, but due to the scale of the game, it's difficult to focus on one specific ship. Furthermore, the animations and movements of ships are minimal - they're basically sitting completely still while little bursts shoot out of their guns. The camera is hard to manage, and the process of zooming in and out often led to my losing track of my units. There's no real parts where you can sit back and just enjoy the cinematic feel of your units blowing up a fleet of enemy ships, even though there is a \"cinematic\" option that gets rid of a lot of the HUD elements. The sound is not particularly great. The music is decent, but forgettable, and the game's voices are really annoying. Overall, they both kind of detract from the experience in general. As a whole, this game has a lot of good ideas, but the execution isn't that great. It feels like it's trying to do much, and while it's ahead of a lot of other games in its specific field, it doesn't feel properly committed to any of its gameplay elements. It doesn't have the detail to be a proper management game, and it doesn't have the tactics to be a proper fleet battling game. However, it's a decent effort at a spacefaring conquest game. 7/10.</td><td>A Lot of Good Ideas</td><td>1224547200</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>103435</td><td>3.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000P297F2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Unlike the main games of the Resident Evil series, \"Umbrella Chronicles\" for the Nintendo Wii is a rail shooter, not unlike House of the Dead or Time Crisis. It's not unprecedented, though; there have been several Resident Evil rail shooter games before in the form of the \"Resident Evil: Survivor\" sub-series. Umbrella Chronicles goes back to various points in the series - from Resident Evil Zero to Resident Evil 3 - revisiting scenes with established characters. The characters that can be used are dependent on what section of the story is being played. For example, in the early sections based on Resident Evil Zero, the characters from that game (Rebecca Chambers and Billy Coen) can be chosen. However, the actual characters chosen don't have a huge impact on the game, since the entire thing is done from a first-person perspective; the only attack that lets you see your character is the \"counterattack\", which is unique for each character and briefly zooms out the camera to play a short cinematic before getting back to the first-person action. The gameplay itself should be familiar to any rail shooter fan. Basically, it's a first person shooter minus the use of your legs - your character moves around automatically, and you, the player, are only responsible for shooting the things in their way. Using either the Wii remote or the Zapper accessory, the player moves the reticule around and targets enemies on the screen. There are a few different weapons in the game; the infinite-ammo handgun, the powerful but slow shotgun, the high-speed submachine gun, and the explosive grenade launcher are but some of the game's weapon types. In addition, there are two non-gun weapon types: the knife, which strikes quickly at close-range enemies, and grenades, which are limited in supply but do large amounts of damage to enemies in a wide range. Dodging enemy attacks is done through quicktime events or, in most cases, simply shooting the monster before they can get their attack off. On-screen prompts will tell to press a button or wave the Wii remote for certain types of attacks (boss attacks, enemy grapples), but most of them simply cannot be dodged unless you shoot the enemy before they can attack. Environments can be interacted with in a limited fashion. Shooting open crates will reveal items that can be picked up - weapons, ammo, health, or files. There are two kinds of health - herbs, which give immediate revival, and first-aid sprays, which act as extra lives, taking effect automatically if the player is reduced to zero health. The last interactive part of the game is doors. Some doors can be shot open to reveal alternate paths; these doors will highlight when moused over, but generally they're discovered accidentally - there's no big indicator saying \"Secret door over here.\" Alternate paths have different items and monsters, so in some cases finding a secret door can be a big help. The gameplay handling is okay, but not great. There is a big discrepancy between basic zombies and other monsters that tend to have armored points and unblockable techniques. The former can be easily dispatched with a few headshots; the latter tend to require reflexes faster than actual reloading can allow for in a lot of cases. Furthermore, with the rareness of checkpoints in levels, dying can be a major setback and source of frustration. The game does feature co-op gameplay, though, which adds to its old-school appeal. Not all modes and levels support co-op, though there is an unlockable form of co-op that expands the range of levels that can be played with 2 players. The graphics and sound are hardly worth noting; neither has really improved from Gamecube incarnations of the series like Resident Evil 4 or Resident Evil Zero. They're not bad, just not particularly impressive, either. There's no really noteworthy music, and the voice acting is as hammy and overplayed as it usually is. If you don't take it seriously, the voice acting isn't too bad. As a whole, the game is kind of an annoyance to play. Despite the old-school roots, Umbrella Chronicles screws too much up to really be fun. The inclusion of co-op is nice, but there's not that much substance to the game overall. If you're an old-school rail-shooter fan, then it's all right; otherwise, there's not a lot that's new or inventive about it. 6/10.</td><td>Old School Rail Shooter</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>151540</td><td>3.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00113JSCG</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Despite being a successor to the early 90s horror series Alone in the Dark, the new Alone in the Dark game is only partially related to those old games. It has its own merits, and its own shortcomings, but does not seem particularly related to previous games and must be considered more as a stand-alone game. The story of the game involves a doomsday cult trying to summon an ancient evil using Edward Carnby, the private detective and protagonist from Alone in the Dark (the original), who has been brought to the present by unknown means and has amnesia. At first, the evil presence (marked by glowing cracks in walls that move and seek out prey as if alive) is limited to a single building, but it quickly spreads throughout the entirety of New York City, leaving Edward trapped in Central Park. As far as stories go, this is a decent one for a survival horror game, and there are a lot of good scares and surprises. In the beginning, you're trapped in a building where the very walls are trying to get you, and in addition you're also dealing with zombies - people swallowed up by the cracks brought back as malicious outlets for the main demon to speak and act through. The main demon's voice is kind of bad, though - it's the same deep monster voice that has basically become a cliche in movies about demons, and it makes the glowing cracks go from \"unidentified, unintelligent, but malicious entity\" to \"scary-voiced demon guy\". In fact, as far as scares go, the main problem with Alone in the Dark is that you're so rarely alone. Besides the short-lived survivors you encounter throughout the game, you also have a sidekick, Sarah, who comes and goes throughout parts of the game. Well, \"sidekick\" is a bit generous, since there's not a lot of cooperative gameplay involved. But the point is that there's no feeling of isolation; it's more like a disaster movie that happens to have monsters in it. The standard gameplay is a fairly regular survival-horror control system. The game is normally played in third-person, with somewhat awkward tank-style controls (IE you have to walk, then turn, then walk, rather then just turning while you walk). The camera in particular is hard to manage, and trying to look around while moving or anything besides walking in a straight line was pretty difficult to manage. Aiming firearms is done exclusively in first-person, but melee combat has a bit of a unique twist to it - it's done in third person like normal gameplay segments, and swinging melee weapons is done by \"swinging\" the right thumbstick from one direction to another. This works pretty well in most cases, and it changes depending on the weapon being used. For example, with long weapons like 2x4s or swords, you only have the option to swing horizontally or vertically. However, with heavier items like fire extinguishers, you can also use the item as a battering ram to smash down doors. Most of the enemies in the game can only be temporarily defeated by weapons, and must be consumed by fire to be fully destroyed. To this end, innovating ways to use fire as a weapon is one of the most important parts of the game. The most basic form of this is to light a melee weapon on fire by sticking it into the flames; the flames don't last forever, but they're an instant-kill to most of the monsters that you'll face, and the enemy cowers and flees accordingly. In fact, I would say that swinging a burning 2x4 while your formerly aggressive zombie enemies cower and flee before you is probably the most satisfying part of the game. There are other methods as well that must be thought up with more open thinking - things like molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers made out of a can of hair spray and a match. While the \"make weapons out of things to defeat your foes\" aspect is pretty much limited to fire, the fact that fire is what destroys your enemies makes it at least plausible. Your inventory in the game is represented by the holsters and pouches in your jacket. The left side of your jacket is used for small items like boxes of ammo or batteries, there's a holster for a gun and a flashlight on your chest, and the right side is used for bottles and cans of various types. The fact that there's a legitimate, actual inventory (you actually look down in first-person to access it, and it's in real-time too so you have to hurry and put stuff together instead of just calmly making a molotov cocktail during a pause) helps with the atmosphere that's being created. In a similar manner, wounds show up on your body and must be healed with either bandages or a first-aid spray. There's no health bar (as with the inventory, all HUD elements are minimal in this game), but you can get a general idea of how injured you are by the status of your wounds (which are still present after being healed, but aren't red and open). You also get a phone/PDA at a point in the game that allows you to make calls and gives you access to a GPS map of the area you are in. In many situations it's necessary to hotwire a car or activate a fusebox (which is done in real time, often with monsters closing in on you) by picking the right wires to spark together. You're often frantically pressing wires together hoping that they're the right ones but doing it quickly enough to get away from the monsters closing in on your car. This is a pretty good part of the game in an atmospheric sense. Driving the car is another thing, though; the controls are wonky and in most cases the demands of the game as far as getting away from giant apocalyptic cracks in the road are a little bit over-the-top. I spent a good hour on what is really a five-minute segment where you're trying to get away from a giant series of cracking roads and earthquakes because the car didn't turn enough, or it turned too much, or I hit another motorist and the car got stuck, or I hit something at a bad angle. The last one in particular is annoying; at the end of the sequence in question, you're supposed to go flying out through a window in a building, but the first time I got there, I assumed that was what was supposed to happen, but I hit it at an odd angle and I didn't go through (I left a mark on the glass though). The next two times I made it there, I tried looking around for other exits but got blocked off. Only on the last time did I realize what had happened and just drive straight into the glass. The graphics in the game are pretty good; the best graphics are the fire graphics, which flicker and dance pretty realistically, while the worst are probably the wounds that Edward receives on his body. The idea's neat, but in actuality they're just the same image copy-pasted onto different parts of his body. The \"slash that ripped through cloth and pierced the skin\" image looks okay when it's on his pants or shirt, but when it's on his jacket it just looks like someone slapped it on like a sticker. Also, you get the same kind of wound no matter how you got the injury. Overall, though, the graphics are decent and atmospheric. The sound isn't bad, but the music just feels wrong. It's a nice attempt at atmospheric music, but most of the time it's not so much \"scary\" as it is \"epic\", with giant sweeping musical interludes and ominous chanting that fits more with \"Carmina Burana\" than a horror movie. It just feels overstated, and not particularly scary. Furthermore, it gets old pretty quickly, too. As a whole, the worst part of Alone in the Dark is its execution. It has a lot of good ideas, and most of the elements taken by themselves are pretty sound. However, the actual execution of the ideas - the controls, the situation, the atmosphere - are all really terrible and frustrating, and the game seems more like a battle against the game itself than against any monsters or puzzles. The interactive environments seem more linear than natural; despite the fact that it's supposed to be stuff that's done in a manner that makes it seem \"realistic\", there's so many scripted sequences that it's hard to get into it. As a whole, Alone in the Dark deserves a 6/10 - good ideas, but poor execution.</td><td>Good Ideas - Poor Execution</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>149066</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000ZK7ZMQ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Soul Calibur, in its heyday, was one of the most respected fighting series.  However, after Soul Calibur II, the series seems to have lost its way and lost focus. Soul Calibur IV is in many ways a victim of that lost focus. The core mechanics remain roughly the same. Each character has a different weapon, ranging from axes to swords to staves. Each character has different moves that are based on a combination of vertical and horizontal-based attacks. There's also a system of parrying and dodging, as well as traditional guarding. In previous games, the system was fun and balanced, allowing for fast-paced but highly technical fights. However, in Soul Calibur IV, while the basic system has been carried over, in a lot of places it feels much less technical and much more like \"hit them with the same attacks that you know work\". One specific example of this is Mitsurugi's standard one-two vertical combo, which hits fast enough that if you catch someone in it, they won't be able to counter with any move because it hits so fast that it interrupts any move they try. I have literally been part of a battle online that consisted of my opponent and me (both Mitsurugi) either attacking with that move or guarding against it and hoping for a lucky parry so that it would be our turn to attack with that move. It's also possible to get a \"Ring Out\" by knocking the enemy out of the arena, but in SC4 this option feels really cheap - what's supposed to be a detailed swordfight quickly becomes \"who can throw the opponent out first\" due to SC4's poorly handled physics. In one team match, I won consecutive battles by simply standing near the edge and using the same throw any time a new challenger appeared on screen. The major new game mechanic introduced for SC4 is the \"Critical Finish\" mode. Both fighters in a match have a \"soul gauge\" that increases when they hit their opponent and decreases when they guard against enemy attacks. When a character's soul gauge decreases enough, they go through a \"soul crush\", which is a short window for the other player to perform a Critical Finish. The Critical Finish is an instant-kill attack; however, the shortness of the life bars and the rarity of finding someone who guards enough to actually lose their soul gauge means that it's not an over-spammed attack that gets used all the time, but rather a way to finish off a long and difficult battle with a tide-turning attack. In most cases, it's usually easier to just kill an opponent than to try to hit them while they guard enough times to cause them to lose their soul gauge. In addition to the Critical Finish, the other new game mechanic is breakable armor. Each character has three \"segments\" - high, middle, and low. Repeated attacks to an area will break off the upper layer of armor on that area (leaving undergarments intact, of course) and make that area more vulnerable. It doesn't really add much to the game, and as a game mechanic feels kind of useless. There are a few new characters in the game. Hilde is the only real \"new\" Soul Calibur character; she's a female knight with a neat fighting style that uses both a sword and a spear, and she's fun to play as. Raphael's adopted daughter Amy returns from SC3, where she was a guest character; she uses a style similar to the Rapier style from SC3. There are also 2 guest characters from Star Wars in each game - both game modes have The Apprentice from the upcoming \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\", the PS3 version has Darth Vader, and the XBOX 360 version has Master Yoda. Vader and Yoda are both decent characters, but The Apprentice is ridiculously overpowered, possessing one of the highest speeds in the game as well as high damage and force powers. When encountered in arcade mode, he is far more difficult to defeat than any other character in the game, and it's even worse when someone picks him in online mode. Finally, there are five characters guest-designed by prominent Japanese artists. None of these have a unique style; each simply takes the style of an established character and uses their own unique weapons. These include a dual-sword Samurai woman, a club-wielding ogre girl, and a bizarre moon person. None of them are particularly well-designed, though, and they're not even that fun to play. They don't even have the unique styles of the Star Wars characters to make up for it. All in all, the new characters for this game, other than Hilde, feel like wastes of time and space. There are a couple different modes for single-player. The basic story mode consists of going through five fights against various opponents. The new mode used in most of SC4's single player game types is a tag-team mode, where if you have multiple characters on your team, you can swap them out in the middle of a battle and let the swapped-out character regenerate health. In story mode, you're usually fighting teams of 3 enemies, and depending on the character you play as, you may get allies of your own. The story mode is much shorter due to the fact that there are multiple enemies in each fight. In addition to story mode, there's also a more traditional arcade mode where you fight eight single enemies in a row; this more resembles the single-player mode of previous Soul Calibur games. The other new single-player mode is the Tower of Lost Souls. This is a mode where you go through floors of a tower, two or three at a time. Each set of floors has a different \"gimmick\" and a different boss; for example, one set of floors has a \"clown\" or \"harlequin\" gimmick, while another has a \"knight\" gimmick. There is a secret goal on each floor that is hinted at when you start the floor; completing this objective unlocks a new piece of clothing for use in creating characters. The multiplayer modes in this game took the largest hit. In previous SC games, there were a wide variety of match styles and gameplay styles that could be used for multiplayer. In SC4, the two styles are limited to a regular match, with or without bonuses provided by equipping different weapons and items. The team-based system used for single player does not get used for multiplayer, despite its prominence in the single-player mode. The new addition for multiplayer is online mode, which functions the same as regular versus mode in that it only has two modes. The online mechanics are, at least, smooth and relatively problem-free, if a bit simple. There are levels in online play, but unlike games like Halo 3 and Metal Gear Online, it's not an average of how good a player you are, but rather a tally of how many times you've won (like an RPG). It's possible to look for a player within your level range, but it doesn't really matter that much, since levels have nothing to do with ability. The game plays smoothly if your connection is four or five bars, but starts to lag insufferably at 3 bars and lower. Create-a-Character is in many ways the heart of this game's unlockable content. Creating a character has been simplified and improved in many ways. The unique Create-a-Character styles from SC3 have been removed, so every CaC now uses a regular fighter's style (however, you don't have to go unlocking styles like you did in SC3, either). Another addition in creating a character is physique customization. It's possible to determine how muscular a character is and how much physique they have. For men, a high physique means that they are bulky and wide-chested, while a low physique means they are thin and scrawny. For women, a high physique means that they are busty and curvy, and a low physique means that they are thin and flat. The difference between the extremes is clear and easy to see (something that's fairly rare for this type of \"sliding bar adjustment\"), and it's neat that they let you change it. There's a variety of faces and voices, but it seems like there's too many \"extremes\" (really young faces and voices, really old faces and voices) and not enough average stuff. There's 8 faces for males and 8 for females, but two of each are really young and two of each are really old, which really means there's 4 average faces for males and 4 average faces for females. The same goes for voices, as well, except that the personalities of each voice are also very different. The hairstyles, at least, are relatively diverse and cover a wide range of styles, short and long. Supposedly, there's an alignment system in SC4 that changes how good/evil your character is (or, at least, there's different endings in story mode where a custom character will either claim Soul Calibur, Soul Edge, or both, depending on his or her alignment), but unlike SC3 it's not visible, and the voices don't change either. I had a character who had a kindly voice and only said kind things, but who still claimed Soul Edge (the evil sword) in the end. The clothes for Create a Character deserve special mention. The only nice-looking clothes in the game is the armor, which is all intricately designed and looks really fantastic. However, a lot of basic clothes that would make sense in the game - for example, a set of tights that covers the whole body, so that the armor isn't just sitting on bare skin - aren't actually in the game. It seems like the costume creators spread themselves too thin; while there's only a few armor sets for female characters, there are at least four uniforms that are just there to be goofy - a maid uniform, a waitress uniform, a stewardess uniform, and a nurse uniform. None of these make sense in the game's context; they're just there so you can play dress-up. Furthermore, there are only two ways to unlock new clothes - either by going through the Tower of Souls (and unlocking only a single piece of clothing per floor) or by getting \"honors\", SCIV's version of achievements, which range from simple tasks like \"beat story mode\" to more complex ones like \"land 10,000 total attacks on an opponent\". In SC3, it was enough to go through the strategy-like sub-mode to unlock new clothes; in SC4, it feels a lot more limited, and since Create-a-Character is one of the most emphasized modes in the game, it feels really unusual. Customizing a character also adds stat bonuses and skills. For this reason, you can customize regular characters with Create-a-Character, too. You can either add items and change weapons for their default costumes (to give them stat increases) or you can give them their own costume made up from Create-a-Character parts, though for whatever reason you can't use their \"normal\" hairstyle and have to use their 2P hairstyle (or any of the other create-a-character hairstyles) if you want to customize them. Different clothes in the game provide different bonuses, either to stats (attack, defense, and health) or to skill points. Skill points are used to assign skills of various categories, ranging from things like \"automatic guard impact\" or \"automatic unblockable attack\" that will randomly aid you in battle, to \"health drain\" that sucks health out of enemies and gives it to you, to skills that increase your stats when fighting enemies of a certain gender or alignment. The skills and stats are kind of neat, but they also affect the character-creation process, when you feel like you have to buy stuff that gives good stats, instead of just getting stuff that looks neat. Thankfully, in versus mode (regular and online) there is an option to play the game without any stat modifiers or skills, which means that you can just have fights between characters without worrying about that stuff. The graphics in this game are really good - as mentioned, the armor in particular looks really nice. The costumes for the main characters have gotten a bit more ridiculous in most cases, but the new character, Hilde, has a really neat set of armor, and the create-a-character option allow for a lot of good armor choices as well. While the other clothes look okay, only the armor and the weapons really show off the game's graphics, with their reflective properties and intricate detailing. The game's backgrounds are pretty good, as well, but nothing particularly noteworthy or epic like some of the stages from SC2 and SC3. The audio is decent, but there's nothing really worth pointing out in terms of music or voicing. As a whole, Soul Calibur 4 is a disappointment that can be fun, but for the most part isn't. SC4 took all the complaints about SC3 and made them worse, and lost most of the things that made the series fun in SC1 and SC2. A lot of the systems and gameplay modes are really poorly handled. The only really fun thing in the game is messing with create-a-character, but despite the physique customization options, the incredibly limited number of faces, voices, and clothing sets kind of puts a damper on the whole experience. Really, it feels like SC4 is trying to do too many things at once, and isn't accomplishing any of them. If the game consisted wholly of a more fleshed-out character maker and a multiplayer game with some more game types, it might be better. As it is, though, Soul Calibur 4 only deserves a 7/10.</td><td>Should be More Fleshed Out</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>108924</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000R3BNHE</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>A long-awaited sequel to \"Nights into Dreams\" for the Sega Dreamcast, \"NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams\" has a similar theme to its predecessor. The main character, NiGHTS, is an acrobatic being who flies around a dreamscape battling creatures of nightmares. The main character is NiGHTS, a mischievous jester who works against a being that seeks to take the spirits of people who dream. The two other protagonists are a young boy and a young girl, who for their own reasons have been having nightmares recently and come to the dream world to escape their problems. However, only through defeating the evil being can they save the paradise of their dream-world. The game looks 3d, but is actually 2d. The levels are in most cases racetrack-shaped, looping around so that it's more than just a straight line. NiGHTS flies around, leaving a trail of pixie dust as it goes. If the pixie dust is formed into a loop, a small portal is generated that destroys enemies. NiGHTS' main other technique is a drilling boost that smashes into enemies in addition to making NiGHTS go faster. The goal of missions differs from area to area; some involve chasing enemies to find keys, while others simply involve flying through a set number of rings. After completing some missions, boss fights with special conditions will take place - though they're more of \"puzzles\" or \"challenges\" than traditional boss fights. There are also platforming sections where you play as the \"dreamers\" - whichever child is currently \"dreaming\" at that point in the game. When playing as a dreamer, there is a time limit before you are pursued by creatures that try to \"wake you up\" (a \"Night Over\" is basically a \"Game Over\", so waking up essentially equals losing). There are some things you can do to avoid waking up  - finding treasure chests prolongs your time, and you can distract your pursuers by throwing blue chips, which are small collectible items found on the stages. The game is more complicated than it really ought to be, but that's really only in theory - in the game itself the concepts are reasonably accessible. The only problem with gameplay is that, due to the 3d field hiding what's really a 2d track it can be hard to keep track of what's in the foreground and what's in the background. This remained my most constant issue throughout the game - since most of the objects consists of brightly colored, but relatively featureless, shapes, it was difficult to tell things apart, and as such it was easy to become disoriented. The graphics are good - about standard for a Wii game, which means a little bit behind what's considered \"Next Gen\" but still pretty good. The camera (as referenced above) is the biggest problem, often undoing the simple fun of flying around by pointing at an angle that makes it hard to see where exactly you're supposed to be going. Sometimes it switches from a straight-on camera to a third-person following camera, which complicates things even further. As a whole, NiGHTS can be kind of fun, once you figure out how everything works. Besides the main game, there's also multiplayer (local or online) and \"My Dream\", a small garden where the enemies defeated and good creatures saved by NiGHTS are sent and can be interacted with. Both of these add at least some extra play value to the game. It's difficult to say what's wrong with NiGHTS, because there's not much particularly wrong; it's just not fun to play for the most part. It doesn't handle that well, and the camera makes it worse. As a total package, it can be pretty good, but it's kind of difficult - annoyingly so - to pick up. 7/10.</td><td>Learning Curve but Kind of Fun</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>148261</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000ZK696O</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The successor to the Ninja Gaiden game for the Xbox, Ninja Gaiden 2 is one of those rare sequels that seems to improve on everything done by the first game while adding worthwhile new features, enemies, and levels. The basic gameplay is the same as the first Ninja Gaiden game, featuring fast-and-frantic swordplay and various ninja abilities to supplement it. You play as Ryu Hayabusa, last ninja of the Dragon Clan lineage, and your mission is to seal the ancient Arch-Fiends away before they destroy the world. The action is almost non-stop in NG2; Ryu has a wide array of acrobatic actions at his disposal to aid in his swordplay. There are fast and slow attacks that can be linked as a combo for different effects, and there's a lot of leaping and diving to throw into the mix as well. In addition to melee weapons like a sword, a staff, claws, and a scythe, Ryu also has a few ranged weapons as well - shurikens (regular and exploding) and a bow. Finally, Ryu has certain magical abilities like fireballs and cutting winds to attack his enemies with, though their use is limited. His enemies range from ninjas - armed with equipment similar to Ryu's - to demons, large and small. The gameplay is smooth, but fast and unforgiving. Your enemies attack ferociously and without mercy - no fair-play \"one on one\" duels here, your enemies will be doing their absolute utmost to make Ryu die. Human enemies (the ninja) have a wide variety of \"abilities\", for lack of a better word, that differentiate them from other random grunts in other games. The ninjas in Ninja Gaiden can lose limbs (arms or legs) and keep fighting - and this will happen a lot, be assured. Heavily injured enemies will try to grab on to Ryu and detonate their bomb as a last-ditch suicide attempt. Ninja types range from melee combatants with swords and claws to ranged types with bows and magic spells. Even without these skills, it's hard to keep up with their attacks, which require dodging, guarding, evading, and counterattacking to deal with - you can't just wade in and mash the attack buttons and expect to survive. The demons are even harder, being less predictable, depending on their type. Some are small, bat-like creatures that swarm Ryu faster than he can swing his sword, while others are hulking colossi that can grab Ryu and squeeze the life out of his body. There are bosses on every level as well - these enemies are generally much larger than any regular enemy, and their strength makes guarding useless, forcing Ryu to jump and dive for his life. Furthermore, they're not fazed by your attacks, requiring you to time your attacks so that you'll have time to escape before they counterattack. Overall, Ninja Gaiden is a relatively simple game in that it keeps the same basic premise for combat; there aren't really any segments that deviate from the established gameplay. As a whole, the controls are good and also notably responsive. In some other games, you have to adjust your timing to the game and pause between pressing buttons so that the moves you've inputted can be executed. In NG2, the game moves roughly about as fast as you push buttons - if you're smashing the buttons really quickly, then the moves will get executed really quickly. To give an example, Ryu has the ability to walljump between two adjacent parallel walls. At first I thought I had to adjust my timing to wait for when he landed; I quickly realized that I could just mash the A button and ascend as quickly as I tapped. The game really rewards you for having good reflexes, and tries not to hinder you as best it can. The only really annoying parts about the controls are the camera (which is kind of unresponsive at times) and sensitivity with regards to hanging on pipes and running on walls, both of which have to do with the camera (since running on a wall is \"running forward\", if the camera changes it can mess you up mid-run). The graphics in the game are really good looking, though \"realistic\" isn't quite the word that I'd use to describe them. They're clearly fake, but it's on purpose, so even though the characters have flawless, one-tone skin with no wrinkles or anything, it looks good and like it was done on purpose. The in-game graphics are really good, too. Combat is quick and highly cinematic without distracting or detracting from the gameplay experience. The most notable detail is the bodies, which are persistent - kill a bunch of ninjas, and their bodies don't fade (not while onscreen, at least). Furthermore, I never thought I'd think of blood and severed limbs as being \"artistic\", but this game really has the prettiest blood sprays and dead bodies that I can think of. Blood splatters on walls depending on the angle that you cut, and you really get the feeling with this game that you're an absolute ninja murder-machine. One of the more impressive details is the blood that accumulates on your blade - when a fight is over and Ryu stands idle for a few seconds, he whips the blood off the blade (throwing an extra splatter onto the floor) and re-sheathes it. The sound in the game isn't particularly notable, except that the sounds of combat are really well shown - the clangs and screams, in addition with the music, create a mood-setting level of background noises that keep you in the action. The music in general doesn't have any tracks that are particularly good, though. As a whole, Ninja Gaiden 2 is a really fun game to play - one of the first games in a while that really feels like a game and not just an interactive story. Flimsy demon-based story aside, Ninja Gaiden 2 is really just an excuse to kill a bunch of ninjas and demons with fancy moves and look really awesome while doing it. The only real problem is that the game is so hard that it might be intimidating to casual players, but for players with good reflexes and a strong will Ninja Gaiden 2 offers nothing but good, fun gameplay. 9/10</td><td>Fun Fast Furious</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>116056</td><td>3.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000UUATJ2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Kane and Lynch is a co-op based third person shooter. The game's dark storyline and interesting characters and character development add personality to an otherwise lackluster shooter. The game can be thought of as a combination between a third-person shooter and a squad game. Playing the game involves a lot of use of cover and blind shooting, similar to Gears of War. You can aim more carefully, which zooms your view in (there's no first-person mode, though). However, the controls are kind of awkward as a whole;  moving into cover is haphazard, as you'll only \"take cover\" by standing next to an object that can provide cover, and there's no visible indicators or buttons to press to actively try and take cover. Shooting is equally questionable; despite their highly visible bullet trails, none of the guns really feel that solid, and none are particularly accurate. Even when you're zoomed in, shooting is pretty much a random exercise where you spray as many bullets as you can at a target and hope you hit them. The bullet spread is really unrealistic and almost all the bullets go completely off course. In most cases, there are only two characters, the titular Kane (the first player) and Lynch (the second player, or AI-controlled in single-player mode), but in some missions you will receive extra subordinates. Your subordinates are controlled with a simple \"Attack/Move/Follow Me\" command setup similar to many squad-based action shooters. However, they never seem to do much, really; sure, they're each an extra gun firing at your enemies, but their contributions never seem particularly significant. If one of your allies is downed, you must go to them and administer adrenaline before they die; if you yourself are downed, an ally will try to get over to you and administer adrenaline to you. However, the latter seemed to be about a 50/50 chance of them actually reaching you in time, so it really just seemed easier to load a checkpoint. Multiplayer only has one mode, but it's at least fairly imaginative - all the players must try to escape from the (AI-controlled) police after a bank heist. It's not a simple matter of cooperating, as players can kill each other to take their victim's share of the money, but by doing so they become a juicier target themselves. The interaction between players and the combination of paranoia and necessary teamwork is at least a nice effort to separate the game from traditional deathmatches. The graphics are okay, but not cutting edge. In cutscenes, they look okay, but once the game is actually going the motions and animations change from being reasonably natural to being awkward and jerky. The most annoying thing is the bullet trails mentioned earlier, which make the game feel silly and unrealistic and detract from the serious atmosphere that it's trying to promote. The sound is pretty good, but not noteworthy except for the voice acting, which is done well. The best part of the game, hands down, is the characterization, the acting, and the plot. All of those are done well, and this game would make a great movie. Unfortunately, the gameplay and the graphics drag its actual value as a \"game\" down, and all-in-all it's not that fun to play. 6/10</td><td>Gameplay and Graphics Lackluster</td><td>1224547200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>123693</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000YFOGS8</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>A real time strategy developed by Stardock Studios, the makers of Galactic Civilizations, \"Sins of a Solar Empire\" combines the space warfare of Homeworld and the development and management of Civilizations without really committing to either. In SoaSE, you can play as one of three races: humanity, the psionic Advent, and the technologically advanced Vasari. All three races share the same basic gameplay, though there are some differences in units and technologies. The basic gameplay is based on planets and their gravity well; each planet acts as a \"base\" of sorts that can be upgraded on the planet itself with infrastructure improvements or reinforced with structures built in orbit like defense platforms and construction facilities. Each planet has a gravity well where ships can move around and engage in combat; traveling between planets causes ships to automatically enter faster-than-light speed once they're out of the planet's gravity well. There isn't a lot of specific customization you can do on planets (all building construction takes place in orbit), but there are important things you can do on them nonetheless. Improving the infrastructure of the planet increases the amount of taxes that you get from that planet, and also the loyalty of the planet's citizens. It's also possible to explore the planet to look for resources or artifacts hidden on it. The structures that can be built in orbit range from defense platforms to mining outposts to ship construction yards to trade posts to research stations. Defense platforms, like gauss or missile launchers, have a certain radius and are placed around your planet; due to the size of the gravity well around the planet, you have to consider which trade lanes the enemies will come from when placing your platforms. Mining outposts harvest two of the three resources in the game - metal and crystal (the third being credits, gained by taxation) - from asteroids around the planet. Construction yards are your basic unit-building stations, and can build whatever you've researched. Trade posts generate credits depending on how many of your planets are linked up with them. Finally, research stations (either civic or military) affect how much research you can do - the more stations you have, the more advanced your research can get. Research has four types - civilian (affects planets and buildings), military (affects units that can be created and bonuses they receive), fleet (affects experience and maximum amounts of ships), and artifact (grants special bonuses if you receive alien artifacts). Combat in the game is two-dimensional, and doesn't take advantage of the \"space\" concept like Homeworld did, which is a major disappointment. Rather than a strategy game, the combat feels more like an assortment of numbers stacking up against each other. Ships can't maneuver particularly well, so in most cases the battle strategy consists of lines of ships shooting at each other. The only real thing you can try to do is maneuver toward your planetary defenses so that they'll be shooting your enemies as well. The only real thing that makes this acceptable is the intended size of battles and the number of battles that can be going on simultaneously once your empire expands. It's easy to keep track of ships due to the sidebar interface that shows all ships (friendly and enemy) near a given planet, and furthermore if you zoom out enough, all the ships show up as icons that allow for easy real-time management. In short, this is a strategy game, but more on an indirect scale of numbers vs numbers, rather than a direct tactical level. The variety of units in the game - from small corvettes to long-range missile frigates to gargantuan dreadnoughts - keeps things interesting, but in the end it all comes down to numbers. Besides ship-to-ship fighting, the other part of galactic conquest is taking planets. This is done by nuking the planet from orbit with either capital ships or specially-made siege frigates. As missiles fall on the planet, its infrastructure decreases; when it's down fully, it can be captured. Depending on the planet's loyalty to its previous owner, it might be difficult for the new planet to adapt to your empire, and rebellion is entirely possible if the planet's inhabitants are mistreated. The other, more peaceful way of getting new planets is to colonize an uninhabited planet. The colonized planet is generally much more loyal than a conquered planet, though the infrastructure and upgrades start at their base levels. Diplomacy also plays a key factor in the game; when playing against AI opponents, you will often be given missions that can raise your standing with them, making them more likely to agree to a ceasefire or an alliance. It's also possible to put bounties on the heads of players - rewards and incentives for other players to attack them, essentially. Finally, you can hire pirates to raid certain planets and upset your enemy with no cost in terms of your own ships. The graphics are decent, but minimal - the details are good, but due to the scale of the game, it's difficult to focus on one specific ship. Furthermore, the animations and movements of ships are minimal - they're basically sitting completely still while little bursts shoot out of their guns. The camera is hard to manage, and the process of zooming in and out often led to my losing track of my units. There's no real parts where you can sit back and just enjoy the cinematic feel of your units blowing up a fleet of enemy ships, even though there is a \"cinematic\" option that gets rid of a lot of the HUD elements. The sound is not particularly great. The music is decent, but forgettable, and the game's voices are really annoying. Overall, they both kind of detract from the experience in general. As a whole, this game has a lot of good ideas, but the execution isn't that great. It feels like it's trying to do much, and while it's ahead of a lot of other games in its specific field, it doesn't feel properly committed to any of its gameplay elements. It doesn't have the detail to be a proper management game, and it doesn't have the tactics to be a proper fleet battling game. However, it's a decent effort at a spacefaring conquest game. 7/10.</td><td>A Lot of Good Ideas</td><td>1224547200</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>126457</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>10 21, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000ZKDOV2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Saints Row 2 is a huge multi-game day in the style of Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto. You are the leader of a growing gang, fighting rival gangs, buying real estate, stealing cars, boats, helicopters and more. We have beaten the game - but it took a solid week of playing to do so.

It is solidly for mature audiences only. That being said, the game is amazingly fun for that audience, if you enjoy movies like The Godfather and TV shows like The Sopranos. Even better - the experience is fully interactive and customizable. You start with your character - which can be male OR female! You can be a variety of ethnic types, customize yourself down to your eyebrow shape and cheekbones. There are a variety of hair styles, tattoo options, and a plethora of clothing styles. Your character can be EXACTLY who you want him or her to be. Now you're launched into the world. You break out of jail and have to rebuild your gang from the ground up. There are a number of rival gangs to take on. On one hand the game is linear in the sense that there are scripted sets of events to go through. As you're taking on gang X, you first have to do mission 1, then mission 2, then mission 3. That being said, you can do each mission in any way you wish. If your target is to blow up a limo, you can use a rocket launcher, or chase it on a motorcycle while carrying a machine gun, or any other combination of techniques. It is completely up to you how stealthy or Rambo you choose to go. They did an AWESOME job with the involvement of these storylines. The character movement and \"acting\" (motion and voice) are really great. You start to get emotions for these characters - either for or against. Some of the scenes are pure poetry in motion. It really is like being in a well done movie. In addition to these main storylines there are also a wide variety of side missions. Steal whores from enemy gangs. Repo random cars from delinquent owners. Take on hitman assignments. Do timed boat races. Some of these tasks are rather challenging. I love the plethora of \"in jokes\" all over this game. There are numerous references to other games, to movies, to TV shows. Many of them are laugh out loud funny.  It's well worth it to read a walkthrough after each mission to see what things you might have missed about it. Down sides? I was let down by the ending, but of course I won't say why. The rag doll physics were a BIT extreme. I suppose it's better than having stiff-as-board characters but they went a little too much on the wet-noodle effect. The game froze on us several times during playing, and we're rather sure it's not our XBox as we use this thing non stop all the time for our reviewing and haven't had issues with it before. There's the usual continuity problems. You'll be looking at a vehicle, turn your head, turn back and it's vanished. A plane will be landing, you'll drive to get ahead of it and BLINK it'll be gone. Up sides? I love the get-injured mini-missions where you try to get yourself tossed in the air by car crashes. The fact that you can customize your bodyguards to all wear SWAT uniforms or ninja outfits is a lot of fun. They did a great job with the extras in here.  I love that you can go walking down the street and randomly run across singing barbershop quartets (who sing lovely harmony!) or tai-chi enthusiasts. Plus the music track is awesome! All in all the game is incredibly engaging, should last most gamers weeks if not months of fun gameplay and has a wealth of tiny details in every corner. The fact that they can have an enormous map like this, with waving leaves on trees, buildings you can go running around inside, no loading screens during normal map travel, fading shadows, rain, sun, steam drifting up from manhole covers, an overhead train, people hailing taxis - it really does feel like an active, living, moving city. It is awe inspiring to me, having seen computer games \"grow up\" from the Pong level, that we could even look at a game of this complexity and consider it to have flaws because the people are a little wiggly boned. It is in many ways a gritty, urban, hard core work of art.

Eye of Judgment uses an actual camera to view a playing field set out and translate the cards placed down by the player into monsters on the game screen. The technology behind it belies the fact that, for all intents and purposes, Eye of Judgment is a regular Collectible Card Game. The difference comes from the Playstation Camera - the titular \"Eye of Judgment\" that's used to watch over a 3-by-3 game mat. The cards - a starter deck is included with the game, and booster packs can be bought separately and scanned in - are marked with bar codes that the Eye recognizes, and thus when they are put into their specific grid of the playing mat, they are brought to life in the form of a 3d model on the game screen. The card game itself is reasonably simple. Creatures are summoned onto one of the nine tiles by using mana. Each creature has an attack pattern, special abilities, health, and an element. Positioning creatures advantageously (in a good position to strike enemy creatures, on a tile that matches its element) have an advantage over those not placed as well. Attacks do damage based on the attacking and defending creatures, and each creature has a certain number of health points that it can lose before it is destroyed. The objective of the game is to occupy five of the board's nine tiles. The graphics in the game consist of the monsters \"summoned\" from the cards and the arena that they fight on (several different types are available). Both are pretty good, though most of the \"coolness\" of it comes from the fact that the monsters have been called up via cards. By themselves, the graphics aren't particularly incredible. Monsters paired up for combat engage in a little mini-arena battle using their unique attacks and techniques. Besides individual strengths and weaknesses, monsters have their own animations, sounds, and quotes - each monster seems pretty well detailed, even though the cards in the starter pack tend to be lots of the same monster. It encourages you to go out and buy more cards just to see how they look in 3d, which is more than can be said of a lot of collectible card games. The only difficult part of the game is, perhaps, the Eye itself - the Playstation camera is for whatever reason difficult to align properly so that it can see the entire board, and as such even with a flat playing field the camera was sometimes not seeing enough of the field, or not enough of one side. As such, the cards on that side wouldn't register. Also, the interaction between the hand putting down cards and the field were kind of wonky, as well; putting a hand over a card would sometimes make the game forget it was there (though this is more a problem in short-term modes like the battle arena than in the actual games). As a whole, Eye of Judgment is a neat idea with a good execution. Online multiplayer and booster packs both add life to the game, and though it does start to feel sort of commercial, the same is true of any other CCG as well. At the very least, Eye of Judgment delivers the long-awaited fantasy of putting down a card and having a computer-generated monster pop up - at least in some form, anyways. 8/10.</td><td>Collectable Cards Spring to Life</td><td>1224547200</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>121245</td><td>5.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>10 20, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>000711835X</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I remember when I first began reading the Hobbit, when I was 7 or 8, absorbed immediately by the young, innocent hobbits. Like me, they were drawn into a world with strange races, people of every shape and size, all with their own hopes and desires, languages and cultures. I was hooked. I've reread the series many, many times since then, and have had the joy of seeing my own son become completely enamored with it. I still name characters 'Aragorn' when I play computer games, because he became such a symbol to me of honesty, integrity, perseverence against all odds. Some girls dreamt of handsome princes. I dreamt of a man who, while not 'fair of face', was the protector of innocents, the defender, the one who strove and fought without reward. In a world where so many books are full of sex, gratuitious violence, disrespect, infidelity, etc. etc., it is amazing to go back to this book that was researched to the Nth degree and promotes that honesty and justice, after hard work and effort, does finally win out in the end. It's not a sugar-coated book, though. There are betrayals, there are sad scenes and suffering. If anything, the book does a great job to show that no matter what someone looks like, or where they come from, they have the same basic longings and needs. If someone comes to think that dwarves and elves and hobbits and such are all able to work together, then our silly concerns about 'shades of grey' in humans' skins seem amazingly shallow. If you haven't read this yet, please do. It is one of the best written and thoroughly researched books of the past few centuries.

It stands as a bit of a departure from regular Square-Enix RPGs in a lot of ways, and while it has its attractions as an overall product it's somewhat disappointing. TLR plays like an RPG, except that every \"unit\" is actually a small squad made up of 1 to 5 people. These \"unions\" are given orders as a group - a union can be assigned to attack, to use magic, to heal, and so on. The \"strategy\" element comes into it during combat; unions attacking enemies will \"deadlock\" them, preventing them from moving to attack other units. A union that engages an already-deadlocked unit with flank them, doing more damage. The goal, then, is to use your more powerful unions to engage enemies directly and keep them out of the path of your support unions (healers and mages, for example). While this may sound simple, the orders you can give your units vary based on context. Depending on unit class (which is affected by actions in battle), you may not get the orders you need at the right time. For example, sometimes units can be told to retreat - and sometimes they can't. You only get five orders at a time, and if the one you need isn't on the list for that turn, there's not much you can do except watch your units die. The game treats experience unusually, as well; by going into battle, your active units increase their hit points and so on, but do not \"gain levels\". Your \"battle rank\" serves as an overall status bar, but it also powers up enemies as you go higher. Essentially, the game levels up dynamically, which means that unless you unlock new skills, you're not really making any process by fighting enemies. The game doesn't really tell you this, though; it's something you'd only learn by referring to guides or the internet. In fact, that's really the game's biggest problem: It doesn't really tell you how to play it. Consider, for example, the fact that you can't give your allies items unless they specifically ask for them. This means that while you may have up to 18 people in your active party, you cannot specifically choose to give them weapons or items. Instead, each character will have items that they'll ask for (if you have them), as well as a list of components they'll request in order to upgrade their current weapons. On the other hand, components themselves are a giant mistake as well; some of them can only be found in literally one spot in the entire world, and even in that spot there is a small chance of actually getting it (so you might never even know it was that spot unless you looked it up). These kinds of things abound in the game, and can have effects on your gameplay without you ever having any reason to assume it. The game's graphics are probably its best feature. As mentioned, you can have up to 18 people on the field at a time, and battles really seem like frantic melees. The range of soldiers available is fairly diverse as well, so even using generic units you'll feel like your party has variety. Cities tend to be designed uniquely, while dungeons feel much more generic and low-quality. The sound design is decent, but not particularly enjoyable or memorable. As a whole The Last Remnant is a fun game, but not a good game. It's worth it if you want to watch the battles, because (rare for an RPG) the combat is actually pretty fun and interesting. However, the frustration factor and the amount of complexity hinders its value as an actual game. What's especially notable about it is that the Xbox 360 version of the game is even worse; there was a huge number of improvements added to the PC version, and it's still a ridiculous mess. 6/10.</td><td>Somewhat Disappointing</td><td>1254441600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>198496</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>10 18, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B002BSA20M</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>A prequel in the long-running Halo series, \"Halo: Reach\" delivers more of the same basic gameplay that's been present since the original \"Halo: Combat Evolved\"...and not much more. Essentially, Halo: Reach is the same game as previous incarnations of the Halo series. The basic gameplay - a first-person shooter with vehicle elements - is intact, albeit with some minor changes. These changes include new abilities (though only one can be \"equipped\" at a time), some new guns (most of which are functionally identical to older ones), and a few short sequences in helicopters or spaceships. Playing the actual basic game feels almost exactly like playing old Halo games, with basically the same weapons, vehicles, enemies, etc. Because it's a prequel, they couldn't really add anything substantial - not that this stopped them from putting in a few new guns and vehicles that never show up in later installments. One of the things that is, in a way, \"new\" is the customization of the main character. Previous Halo games have had customizable characters for multiplayer, starting with picking a color in Halo 1 and developing into different helmets, shoulderpads, and so on in Halo 3. In \"Reach\", the option has become available to pick a female Spartan (this option technically existed in Halo 3, but only affected the character's voice). In addition, the changes made to the model reflect in single-player, as well, since the Master Chief is no longer the main character. A lot of the multiplayer modes from Halo: ODST have been brought over, including the cooperative Firefight mode. Other than that, it seems to be the same mix of multiplayer modes found in previous games - deathmatch, CTF, and so on. It's not bad, but it's not really original, either. ODST at least tried to do some new things with the hub concept and so on. Halo: Reach is just a retread. While this might not be bad, necessarily, it just seems like a lot of effort to go to make a new game with no real new characteristics. Even the voice actors seem bored at this point; all their performances are flat and dull, with hardly any emotion put into it. There's an easy way to determine if Halo: Reach is a game that you, the consumer, will like. Did you like the previous games? Then you will like Halo: Reach. Did you dislike them? Then you will dislike Halo: Reach. It's almost more of an expansion than a new game. It's not a bad game in terms of design or graphics, but it's the same game as previous installments. Rating: 7/10.

Jak has been in prison for 2 years, tortured and infused with dark powers. By the time Daxter rescues him, he's ... different ... Where the first Jak and Daxter was about bright, cheery bouncing to gather up objects, the second Jak has an older, wiser, more cynical guy. The game begins in almost a Grand Theft Auto style, with the cops chasing you down and you carjacking whatever vehicle comes by to get around town. You drive around the streets from spot to spot, getting new missions and proving yourself. The graphics are really good as you bounce, spring and roll your way across the various levels. Daxter has some really cool moves as he tags along with you. There are the normal hop-and-jump platform levels plus tank-chasing-you and other combinations of efforts. The game definitely appeals to the more mature audience of the PS2. While the first Jak and Daxter was an \"E for Everyone\" game that was more of a Super Mario game, this one is darker and more serious. It carries a rating of \"T for teen\" and isn't quite suited for the pre-teen set. There are plenty of games now for the kiddie players, so keep this one for the teen-and-up gamers. It's a more mature platform game, with themes of slums without water, torture and death.

The creators of BG2 have definitely learned from the previous games. The graphics are gorgeous, with a lot of the detailed textures and special effects that we've come to expect. Gameplay is smooth and uses the same interface as the other games - intuitive and easy to learn. You can even hide the interface if you wish. The game carries along the storyline from BG, and you can  import your old characters from the first game. Your friends are still there - even if you happened to kill them off or abandon them in BG. The game developers learned from Planescape - BG2 is very open and epic in feel. None of this linear do-this-now-do-that nonsense. The role play is also great, and the options available to your character at any point are quite comprehensive. Non-player intelligence is boosted in this game - people aren't as likely to get stuck behind a tree or next to a door. In general, BG2 is a great improvement over the original BG, and a worthy follow-up. If you enjoyed Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment, definitely pick this up and play through.

It provides a lot of easy recipes that taste delicious and are nutritious as well. In addition, the book also eases you into many advanced recipes. Looking to cook a Thanksgiving dinner for the relatives? Trying to make a birthday dinner really special? This cookbook has the recipes for you, all easy to understand and with gorgeous photos.

The intro has a glossary of terms and a basic overview of winemaking which is very helpful for those new to the fun. Tables list which kinds of grapes work best for different regions, so those who are planting vines have a best-case scenario laid out for them. Clear instructions tell how to plant the vines, how to prune them, what a trellis looks like, and even harvest details. That's just to start. Now the books goes into the winemaking process, and it shines here as well. The conversational tone makes it easy to follow discussions of pH and brix and pomace. The book offers various normal situations winemakers find themselves in, and solutions to fix them. There is even information on barrel usage and aging techniques. The back appendix section offers places to buy wine supplies, wine societies, common vine pests and treatment, and much more.

Focusing on the management of a larger mercenary organization, \"Peace Walker\" still has its share of stealth-based tactical action. Peace Walker returns to the world of Big Boss, rather than the series' usual protagonist, Solid Snake. In the period between Portable Ops and now, Big Boss has left the US government and assembled his own mercenary team, the MSF. Peace Walker centers around managing the MSF by carrying out missions, recruiting new members, developing new technologies, and building up the off-shore platform used as the MSF's main base. Gameplay is divided into story missions (main ops) and side missions (extra ops). The main ops constitute normal gameplay, broken up into segments. The extra ops are closer to the VR missions from MGS2 - short, timed scenarios with some twist or quirk to them, like \"rescue the hostage\" or \"find the mines\". Mission maps are wider and more detailed than in Portable Ops, and many missions take place in an area consisting of several connected maps, which makes the world seem larger. There are a lot of areas that are wooded or swampy, which calls back to MGS3 and its more natural environments. Another MGS3-like feature is the lack of a \"standard\" radar - items like sonar must be equipped in the item slot and have limited battery life, making players more reliant on their own senses to spot enemies. Managing the MSF is one of the game's major features. New recruits can be captured in the field either by subduing enemies or rescuing hostages. These recruits have a diverse set of stats, and can be assigned to different units, like combat, R&D, or intelligence in a manner similar to Portable Ops. Unlike Portable Ops, every recruit wears the basic MSF uniforms; there's no difference between capturing a guard or a sniper. Characters are instead distinguished by portraits and codenames, both of which are randomly assigned. This allows for some level of identification, although it unfortunately doesn't carry over to actual gameplay. Every character is now represented by a generic masked figure (male or female) except for Snake himself. However, there are different costumes and camouflage uniforms (all of which have masks), and the uniforms have different stealth values and inventory slots. This allows for different types of gameplay depending on the uniform selected. Bosses come in two main types: vehicles and mechs. Vehicles consist of things like tanks and helicopters. Vehicle fights often involve supporting troops - if they're out of the way, the vehicle's commander can be incapacitated or killed and the vehicle can be captured for MSF's usage. Mech fights are more traditional MGS boss fare; instead of capturing them, however, it's possible to salvage parts and AI cores to build your own mech. Both vehicles and mechs can be sent off (along with troops) to missions in other parts of the world. These \"Outer Ops\" are automatically resolved, but provide a way for the majority of your combat forces to get experience (since only one person can sneak at a time). Peace Walker focuses a lot on multiplayer, as well. There's a fairly standard versus mode, but the main attraction of multiplayer is a cooperative mode. This allows for players to attempt missions, or even fight bosses, in groups of up to four. However, multiplayer is limited to nearby PSPs - there's no online match-making mode or anything of the sort, despite the presence of pre-written communication (which should only really be useful if you can't talk to the person in real life). The relative rarity of the PSP means that this feature will most likely go unused. Overall, Peace Walker does a lot of things right that Metal Gear should do right. The bosses are fun, the environments are detailed, and the controls are tight enough to not be a problem. It's not quite the second coming of MGS3, detail-wise, but it's definitely a worthy successor, considering its handheld status. The management aspect is fun and addictive, though the actual logistics of the whole thing could have used some fleshing out. Peace Walker is a solid game both for fans of the series and for those who aren't usually interested in it. Rating: 9/10.

However, for a player willing to overcome a few hardships, Demon's Souls is a well-made, well-executed, highly enjoyable game. Demon's Souls' basic gameplay is hack-and-slash similar to The Legend of Zelda or Kingdom Hearts, i.e. you swing your sword, block with your shield, roll, dodge, and so on. However, Demon's Souls has much higher stakes - your character can die in 2 or 3 hits, for one. Enemies telegraph attacks well enough, and are generally as weak as you are in health terms, so it's at least fair in that regard. It's less that the game is hard directly, and more that the game is unforgiving of carelessness; charging at an enemy as though they can be easily dispatched, like you would in most action games, usually ends up with your death. There's a fairly wide level of customization available in terms of gameplay choices, though. Souls are the game's currency, and are obtained from every enemy defeated. They are used to buy stat upgrades, spells, weapons, armor, and items. In essence, you have a fairly wide set of choices available in terms of how you play the game - as a direct fighter, as a lightly-equipped archer, or as a supporting magic-user. Your class influences your starting stats, but there are very few class-based limitations in terms of equipment and spells. As long as you've upgraded your stats to the right level, you can use almost anything. There is some difference in terms of what weapons are used, so there's at least a lot of diversity in terms of your character's development. In addition to enemy weaknesses, the weapons in the game also take how the weapon is used into account. Most directly, walls and corridors will make it impossible to swing a weapon - a problem if you're using a giant sword and can't get the room necessary to swing it. Generally, stabbing weapons like spears and rapiers are useful in close-range areas, while the giant swings of greatswords and polearms are useful in wide-open areas. It's possible to wield weapons one-handed or two-handed; it's also possible to dual wield weapons, to varying levels of effectiveness. The two kinds of ranged weapon are bows and crossbows: the former can be aimed manually, but requires two hands, while the latter must be locked on automatically, but can be used with a shield. Death in Demon's Souls is frequent, and comes with a few penalties. Upon death you become a ghost, with only 50% of your normal HP (though this is raised to 75% by an item found early on, which is much more tolerable). When you die, you lose all your current souls (but not items or abilities), but if you can get back to the spot you died in and touch your body, you can at least recover it. There are a few ways to recover your body, the most common of which is beating a boss while in spirit form. However, it's often not worth it - you can only beat a given boss once, and it's fairly easy to die afterwards to some simple trap or surprise attack. And given the number of things that are trying to kill you - soldiers, monsters, dragons, rolling balls, pit traps, and the occasional explosion - care should be taken at basically every opportunity. The game's multiplayer is probably its most innovative feature; rather than a direct sort of \"join someone else's game\" feature, Demon's Souls is more like a persistent online world where you can only occasionally interact with other people. The most common online interaction is messages. These messages are assembled from premade parts (\"look out for the ____ ahead\", etc.) and left on the ground near whatever they're talking about. Any player can put down a message, regardless of content, so it can be used to help people (\"there's a trap ahead\", \"don't trust this guy\") or to hinder them (\"if you jump down into this bottomless pit you'll get some treasure\"). Trustworthy messages can be recommended; recommending a message provides the player who put it down with an instant full-heal - something that's not to be sneezed at, especially during boss fights. Therefore, it's to the player's advantage to put down helpful notes, and the game is certainly hard enough to warrant them. In one case, for example, an otherwise innocuous NPC was marked with many runes nearby indicating that said NPC was a liar and I should attack him. As it turned out, the NPC was powering a ritual that made the level's boss immortal, and without killing him I never would have been able to beat said boss. The other way that the game presents a passively online universe is through player ghosts and bloodstains. The former is just a glimpse of other people playing the game - i.e., their characters running around in the same level you are in. These are mostly just there for show, though seeing a ghost pull a lever or break down a wall can provide a helpful hint. When another player dies, their bloodstain is left in the location where they died. If you touch a bloodstain, a ghost pops up and runs through the last few seconds of that player's life. This basically shows you where traps are in a lot of circumstances - you just have to watch for the part where the ghost \"dies\" when you go forward. In some cases, the presence of a great deal of bloodstains serves as warning enough. There are more direct ways of interacting, as well. When you're a ghost, you can offer your services as a Blue Phantom and enter another player's world as a cooperative helper. Beating the level's boss transports you back to your own game and gives you your body back. You can also take the darker path of the Black Phantom and invade another player's world; if you manage to kill them, you get your body back. Overall, there's not a lot of communication possible in-game. The messages serve as the only actual communication; blue phantoms must communicate with gestures and emotes, and there are only a few of these. There's no friend lists or anything along those lines, so you're really just grabbing any random player either as an enemy or a friend. The graphics in the game are excellent - the designs and effects are detailed and well-executed, there are plenty of incredible panoramic views (many of which can be noted with messages) and the characters all move with realistic weight and effort.  On the other hand, the Havok physics used in the game are completely ridiculous. Bodies, for one, can be easily kicked around by a player walking slowly into them, which causes them to go into humongous spasms and flail around. The sound is great, being distinctly atmospheric while also serving as a warning. The music is good, but only shows up for boss fights (in a manner similar to Shadow of the Colossus), while the rest of the game is music-less to let you focus on approaching footsteps or flapping dragon wings. As a whole, Demon's Souls is a great game with solid gameplay and fun online multiplayer. However, it's also a very unique game - casual gamers, people who dislike losing repeatedly, and people who want to play with people they know in real life are probably better staying away. The game's difficulty will drive away most gamers; even gamers who stick with it will likely find it frustrating when they die for the hundredth time. The online mode, while interesting and fun, is limited in its long-term applications due to the short \"pick up game\" nature of coop play. In conclusion, the game is a 9/10 for hardcore gamers, and a 6/10 for casual gamers.</td><td>well-made, well-executed, highly enjoyable game.</td><td>1255564800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>62997</td><td>5.0</td><td>201</td><td>false</td><td>10 15, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0007GBBHI</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I'm a huge fan of Fable, Populous and Black & White. I got Black & White 2 the moment it came out, and dove into playing it. Was it worth the long wait? First, make sure you download the 100mb patch before you start playing. Any save games you make will be incompatible with the patch, and the patch fixes a TON of bugs. It sort of makes you wonder about the QC process, if this was released on the same day as the software was. But in any case, at least they fixed the problems quickly. The game is classic good-bad choices from Peter Molyneux - the creator of fantastic open ended games where you can choose your own destiny. In B&WII this is very much a combination of Creatures and Age of Empires. You are building up your town - placing buildings to please the villagers, tending farms, mining ore. You are also training your creature to be responsible - watering the gardens, entertaining the villagers. That being said you can instead choose to be an evil overlord - starving your villagers, taking over nearby towns, causing destruction. The first B&W really went overboard on the creature micro-management. You were more of a creature nanny than a God. Some people might have enjoyed that - and there are certainly enough NintenDogs and NeoPet games out there to soothe those people who want to spent 24 hrs a day raising a pet. I really found it quite tedious to sit there slapping and petting an animal, when I was a god with a civilization to build. I'm thrilled that they have the whole creature thing much more reasonable. It still takes your attention to set the creature on its path, but you don't have to spend hours on it. You're a God after all. By the same token, if you're looking for a high end killer war - strategy game, this just isn't it. This isn't meant to be like a Command & Conquer or other war engine. War is an aspect of the game, yes, but you are encouraged to bring in people by impressing them just as much as by conquering them. The graphics are of course stellar. There are tons of villagers, each with his or her own name, personality and job, wandering around the village doing tasks. Each tree and flower can be interacted with individually. The sounds are reasonable, with a nice soundtrack that isn't hard to listen to repeatedly as you go through the game using different creatures and aiming for different alignments. The shining essence of this game is of course the choices you make. As you make evil creatures, the world gets more and more grim through each level - and your creature begins to look really violent and depraved. If you choose to make good creatures, the world reacts to that quite amazingly, and your creature reflects those choices. Even the ground on which he / she walks reflects that nature. In the end, you could probably play through the game in 1-2 days, on a single pass. But the fun in the game is to replay it with different creatures and different aims, to see how it affects your world. In this sense it's very much like Fable, a game that was amazingly fun to replay. I found this an extremely well balanced game between the town building, creature taming and god-like powers.

There are trillions of characters and some fun mini-games too. The basic plot - as if this blood-drenched game really needed a plot - is that the Gods are sick of all the fighting going on. They send their two sons down to try to get things under control. In the meantime, there's a gigantic pyramid in which the various Kombatants can duke it out to see who reins supreme. There are many ways to play in Mortal Kombat Armageddon. There is a story mode where you do have a plot - you walk along paths in jungles, explore spaceships, have random fights as you go, gathering up coins and treasures. In arcade mode, you have instant access to about 60 different characters in a series of fights. If you get stuck with one character, you can try again with a new one. The characters are drawn from all of the Mortal Kombat games. Some only showed up briefly in previous games. If you've been following up on the Mortal Kombat saga, you'll see all sorts of references to previous situations and feuds. All the coins you earn in the various stages can be used to unlock items - new skills, new outfits, and more. They actually tell you what you're going to unlock, too! That's a nice change. Also, there's only one type of coin - so everything you earn goes into one bank account for you to spend however you wish. There is a REALLY cool character creating system where you can set up a character, male or female, with exactly the hair, eyes, body shape and costume you want. The tweaking is pretty impressive with eye color, nose shape and more. You expect this level of detail from a RPG - but from a fighting game it's a great bonus. Speaking of bonusses, if you like games like Super Bombad Racing, you're in for a treat. They include an entire racing game as a bonus, with little cartooney versions of Mortal Kombat characters zipping around on a track. Are there downsides to the game? Well, while the arenas you fight in are destructable, have the ability to go from one area to the other and have interactive items, they are not as \"lushly gorgeous\" as a few other XBox fighting games. Also, while it's pretty tame now compared to other mature games, it's worth noting that Mortal Kombat is very bloody. When this series first came out, a lot of people were in an uproar over it. Now the blood spurting out seems almost normal. Still, not a game for little kids. It also seems a bit silly that you have fully detailed cinematics - sometimes VERY long cinematics - setting up situations ... but when you end an important battle you often get a text message saying \"And then [insert important boss name here] decided to stop fighting and run away\". It's a bit anticlimactic. Still, these are minor complaints in a game that is really quite stellar. They let you play tons of characters right from the beginning, so you can easily get to your favorites. They have a ton of things to unlock, and the coin system is very easy. You know WHAT you're going to unlock. And, to be honest, I *love* that they have male and female characters, side by side, kicking butt. I've seen male and female players choosing both male and female characters without any problem, knowing that both can be equally strong and skilled. That really makes me happy, that we've reached this point.

I'm really thrilled with the GameBoy Micro, with its small size and sharp screen. This super-slim design fits perfectly in your pocket or purse, something not easily said for the other GameBoy systems I own. The back-lit screen means the display is always quite crisp. The buttons are easy to use, the screen is quite easy to read. The volume can crank enough for you to understand what's going on. You get a variety of faceplate designs with each purchase, to customize it. I happen to love the pink ladybug design, but friends of mine really like the blue \"ammonite\" display. There's also basic black and other options too. You can play any GameBoy game with this system. You can NOT play old GameBoy and GameBoy color games on this. While some complain about this, heck, the game system is TINY. They simply couldn't fit all that other functionality into this tiny system. To be honest, if I want to play an ancient game, I'll play it on one of my other systems. I rarely want to do that. This micro system is just perfect for all of my modern gaming needs, to carry around with me. Heck, you could complain that this doesn't play DS games either. Well, sure, that's why I own a DS. I have a SP too - but the micro is much smaller and lighter. They are each different systems, for different reasons. It's like having an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar. Sure, they're both guitars - but there are reasons to use them in different situations. I'd use a SP at home - but I'd carry a micro with me when I travel. The Micro *comes* with a little velvet-like pouch. You stick it in the pouch, it's safe. The faceplate covers the display area too - so you can simply switch faceplates any time you run into a scratch, and get a new look too. As far as the smaller screen goes, it actually makes the display more crisp. For those of us with large screen TVs, you now how making an image larger also makes it more fuzzy. When you make an image smaller, you make it more crisp. I was really impressed with how some games looked on this!

The characters you know and love go romping around crime scenes, tracking down clues, figuring out who the perpetrator is. The graphics are a little iffy on this one, which is a shame when the whole point is to peer closely at the screen to find clues. I would love a higher level of quality here. This isn't a game of fast reflexes or killer combat. It's all about observing. You would think the visual layout would be key. In particular the faces of the characters border on scary in their movements. There are only five cases in the game, and there is of course not really any replayability. It is a typical puzzle solver - but it is VERY linear. You might think logically that something is a clue, but you have to do things in the order they want you to. It may be that I've played a number of these games by now and see the limitations of this one in particular, but I know every time I write a walkthrough that people write me in droves when a game is too linear - it frustrates them. The soundtrack can also use some work. I was standing quietly, examining a car, and the soundtrack was thrumming with killer \"a T-Rex is about to eat you!!\" tracks. Not quite appropriate. It's a real shame. CSI is a great TV show, and certainly should have the budget available to hire a quality set of game developers to turn this into an interactive experience. I've played other games with awesome facial features, for example. There are numerous examples of games that involve puzzle solving in a more open environment. The horsepower exists on the XBox 360 - and the designers have already figured out how to do these actions. It just needed to be brought together for this specific game. Part of what concerns me is that new gamers who love CSI might come into this, have lots of problems and think they're the ones at fault. They might think their lack of gaming skills is the issue. We would have lost potential gamers because of poor gameplay. It would be MUCH better if a \"draw in\" game like this that could introduce non-gamers to a console was as easy as possible, and as visually pretty as possible. That way they had fun, enjoyed the experience and then began to try other games as well. I really hope future CSI games fix the single-threaded issue and most definitely the graphic issues.

I happen to love Aerosmith songs so I found the game fantastically fun. The locations are based on places Aerosmith played - Nipmuc high school, the Orpheum, a half time show. They did an awesome job with the \"characters\" in the game, so you really do feel like you're playing the band. And then there are the songs. Aerosmith fans will always complain about them not including song X or song Y, since they didn't include the ENTIRE song library from Aerosmith's full, long career, but they did an awesome job of choosing most of the best. You get Sweet Emotion, Rag Doll, Livin' on the Edge, Love in an Elevator and much more. In addition, there are a collection of non-Aerosmith songs as well, as the warm up bands play. I really like a lot of these songs as well, such as Joan Jett's \"I Hate Myself for Loving You\". Gameplay is pretty much right from the Guitar Hero franchise so if you enjoy playing that, you'll enjoy playing this as well.

The main new feature of the game is the six sub-factions added to the game's existing three sides. In addition to the base sides (GDI, Nod, and the Scrin), each of these sides now has two sub-factions that are similar to the main faction with a specific focus or bent. GDI has the Steel Talons, an armored unit that uses improved mechanized units (specifically, the walkers from Tiberian Sun rather than traditional tanks) at the cost of infantry units, and ZOCOM, who specializes in countering the effects and growth of Tiberium, but has no sonic or artillery technology. Nod has the Black Hand, who have improved flamethrower technology and more powerful infantry units at the cost of air units and stealth technology, and the Marked of Kane, who have a majority of their units as cyborgs rather than traditional soldiers. Finally, the Scrin have Reaper-17, a heavy attack faction that trades subtle units like aircraft for more powerful ground units, and Traveler-59, which focuses more on speed and warp technology and less on actual combat. For the most part these sub-factions are fun and interesting, and add some neat new units to the game. However, they're not particularly ground-breaking; they all fall into the \"specialize in one, less adept in another\" category that's been used for sub-factions in every other RTS. Sure, it's nice to see some new units - or returning old units, like the GDI Wolverine and Titan from Tiberian Sun - but they don't really breathe new life into the game. In addition to these changes, there's a new campaign mode and an alternate mode - either a Risk-like turn-based game for the PC, or a series of challenges and events for consoles. All of these are a nice attempt to infuse some variety into the game, but they all wear thin pretty quickly. Basically, if you liked C+C3, then the game is a welcome pack of new content; if not, it probably won't change your mind. There are some specifics regarding the 360 version of the game, as well. Camera and controls are both handled fairly poorly; the idea of replacing the PC's boxes of options with a simple radial menu for selected units was a nice idea, but as a whole moving around, ordering units, and managing a war are all annoyingly frustrating to pull off. Furthermore, the game's tactical display is too large, covering up a huge percentage of the screen. The graphics in the game are the same as in C+C 3, which is to say decent, but not particularly detailed. For whatever reason, with the Xbox 360 version, the graphics are difficult to see - as in, they all blend in with the background and are not sharp enough to make out as unique units. Therefore, it's unusually difficult to manage your units or see other ones. The minimap is similarly difficult to see. As a whole, Kane's Wrath is a decent attempt at an expansion pack, but doesn't have many virtues on its own. The Xbox 360 version is even worse due to the poor controls and graphics, and deserves special note for its poor quality.

The music is loud and spooky, always making you think that horribly painful death is lurking right around the corner. Most of the time it is, in the shape of enemies who have little knowledge of tactics but do have the numerical advantage. Graphics are all right - a study in black, white and grey sometimes, but a touch more realism might have been nice to draw you more into the story. The rag doll physics are a bit creepy, as bodies fall in extremely unnatural positions and then tumble around inappropriately. There are fighting sections, stealth sections, puzzle sections, a collection of enemy types, new weapons to find, new upgrades for your spinny death-blade. Really, though, the main issue here is that the game begins to feel tedious after a while. The enemies are just a little too much of the same mindset so once you figure them out, you have figured them all out. The bosses are like puzzles, but poorly designed puzzles that give you little feedback. There are ten chapters which is relatively short for a game - and with their save system it seems that you always have to start a load game from the beginning of a chapter. That can get to be a royal pain if you are almost done with a level and need to turn off the system for some reason. How about the storyline? You begin as a reluctant soldier, almost trying to retreat from the assigned mission - but it's too late to go back. As you're in doing your deed, you get infected with a disease. This leads to your connection with the spinning blade of multiple powers. In general, while we've had this game for several months now, we rarely put it in. There are always other games we'd rather play. I would definitely suggest you rent this first, play it for a weekend, see how it appeals to you. Who knows, you might finish the game over the weekend and be all set. If you really do enjoy the game style you can always buy it at that point and go forward.</td><td>Rent First</td><td>1223856000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>101277</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 13, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000O5DS32</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Turok is sort of a space-marines-meets-Jurassic-Park story. In a futuristic world with high end weapons and armor, you're pitted against the raw muscle and razor-sharp teeth of  meat-eating dinosaurs. Really, the game is all about fun. It has nice graphics, but not nearly as stellar as other games out there. The scenery of black mountains and drifting clouds are pretty, but could be better. The character animations are all right, but sometimes clunky and clippy. The voices are all right, but sometimes get flat or cliched. When it comes down to it, this is all about pitting yourself against dinosaurs with the best weapons you could imagine from various sci-fi shows. It's you against bit, sharp-toothed monsters of gigantic proportions. They are faster than you, stronger than you, there are lots of them out there. Can you hold your own against them? The answer hopefully is yes. There are multiple levels of gameplay here, so you can start with the easier one if you haven't played these games before, or just dive into the killer-hard level if you enjoy a challenge. You'll be sneaking around, taking shelter behind jungle plants, plotting out the best place to lay your ambush. Yes, there's a plotline of sort, with crosses and double-crosses. You get your hands on various weapons. Ironically, we tended to stick just with the knife, for silent, deadly kills. The other favorite weapon was the bow with a variety of arrow types. The game is a good length and whether you enjoy it or not probably depends on whether the idea of blasting away at dinosaurs for hours is a fun thing to do. We did enjoy playing our way through it, but it was not one of the games that we kept on the active shelf to revisit for months afterwards. If you're not a dinosaur / monster-slaying fan, it might be best to rent this one for a weekend and see how it appeals to you. That way you could get the dinosaur mashing out of your system if it's not your cup of tea - or get yourself completely hooked and decide to get one of your very own.</td><td>General Mindless Dinosaur-Slaying Fun</td><td>1223856000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>123516</td><td>3.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>10 13, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000YDIYEW</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The expansion pack to Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, \"Kane's Wrath\" adds new units, sides, and features to the original game.

The game is fast, furious and a great challenge for your reflexes and talents. We have played through the game numerous times now, on various settings. They do a great job of offering a gentle introduction for those who need it, as well as a truly insane mode for those who want the ultimate challenge. I wouldn't say any of the levels are a walk in the park, though. The game is all about tense combat situations. You have bullets flying all around you, noise bombarding your head, people screaming out for help. You have to be able to juggle your priorities, have eyes in the back of your head, and have a good stereo system to help you figure out where to turn. The developers did an awesome job here. From the detail of the graphics, the depth of the audio experience, the checkpointing system, everything is pretty top notch. Single player is really a training ground for you. It just isn't that long - you could play through the entire game in a full day, even on the harder levels once you build up your skills. It is meant to teach you how to play, how to strategize and how to prepare for the actual challenge - live humans. Now that being said, it is a REAL shame that there is no co-op mode. Some of the best fun we have in our gaming household is playing games like this side by side. It is amazingly rewarding. Why can't they add that ability in here? It wouldn't be that hard to integrate and it would make the game SO much more useful for us. They do have an XBox Live component, though. This is where things shine. You can now play literally for months and months without getting bored. However, I am aware that a contingent of people out there simply cannot play on the Live network, for a variety of reasons. For those people I might suggest renting the game for a weekend and see how much it appeals to you. It might be you enjoy replaying the single player missions - but it might be that a few times through is enough for you. Finally, I have to recommend that hard core gamers consider getting high quality headphones if there are non-gamers in the household. The noise level of this game is HUGE and it is just constant - screaming, bombs, guns, more screaming. It is great for the player, but less great for other people who are trying to do their normal household activities :)</td><td>Incredible Game for Live Players</td><td>1223856000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>68600</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 13, 2008</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0009V0SYS</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Full Auto is a destructive racing game. Your muscle car is well equipped with machine guns - the question is if you can survive the race, not win it! I enjoy the destructability of the world, as well as the rewind button. I have to say first that every time I go to play this game I laugh my fool head off for the first ten minutes or so. I play a lot of video games (as you might imagine) and many of them have a driving aspect. A key skill I've honed over time is how to drive quickly, instinctively, while avoiding crashes. It is REALLY hard for me to switch to this game where you're often trying to ram head-on into your opponent. I will be racing down the road and literally keep missing the cars I'm trying to hit, because my hands automatically dodge left and right! Once you get the hang of the smashing, the game is a lot of fun. It's really easy, too. I never have to look at the manual - it's just a matter of grabbing a car, choosing a weapons configuration, hopping into a map and smashing away. It's a great stress relief. You have arcade mode which are one-off maps as well as career mode to build up your skills and vehicles over time. They have a lot of vehicle choices, color choices, and interesting maps. There's a lot to enjoy here if you like smashing things with cars. They did a good job with the environment. You can smash into other cars of course, but you can also run down cafe tables, take down light poles and telephone poles, even smash your way through buildings. The whole world disintegrates around you. Blast into a full gasoline tanker truck and watch it go up in a huge fireball. The rewind feature builds up over time and lets you \"backtrack\" after a wrong turn or a head-on collision. It's great fun and helps you extend your time, undoing a mistake. There are multiplayer modes too, where you can play with people either locally on your system or online with XBox Live. Yes, other racing games might have more \"perfect\" car models and racing response, but that's not really what Full Auto is about. Full Auto is a casual, smash-em-up game that lets you play for a few minutes then go on with something else.

We played through the full game multiple times, it really was great fun. The missions all have their main objectives - find the lost woman, shoot down the train, but they also have secondary objectives to encourage you to go back and replay the missions to track them all down. We found the game very replayable and enjoyed multiple passes on the same levels, trying new techniques or faster times. The graphics are quite impressive, from forested hills to ice flows in a frozen sea. The details on the planes is impressive as well and with the variety available you do appreciate having a nice rendering to look at. The game definitely isn't easy. You have to do some very precise flying to get through some of the levels, and I can see how someone new to this type of game could get frustrated. The key is to be patient and practice. Above all, this game is *fun*. There are many other games I play which are frustrating when you're doing poorly and you just want to get them over with. When you do well it hardly seems worth it. With this one, you pour hours into it because you really do get a sense that you're achieving something, you're getting better, your skills are improving, you are reaching objectives. The fast thinking and hand-eye coordination really are useful in the \"real world\". The characters are enthusiastic, the music is stirring, the graphics draw you into the world and the enemies are a challenge, but in a good way. They help you hone your skills and improve.

First, the gameplay. I found this game REALLY really annoying at first. Your guy in essence moves on a \"grid\" and if he doesn't stop in the exact right space, he tends to die immediately. When he crashes or dies, he makes this really annoying noise. So you really have to be calm and relaxed to get through the first levels. It's not \"Frantic\" - it's \"Frustrating\". Still, once you get used to repeatedly dying, then the game falls into a rhythm. You die a few times, looking around the map. You figure out where the water is, the lava, the quicksand, the enemies and so on. Then you try an attempt or two to get the timing down, and eventually you get all the crystals and the gate. Each set of levels has its own look and feel. My favorite is the Japanese tatami-mat themed area, but there's also a desert, a medieval style castle, and so on. In each situation the aims are pretty much the same. Push blocks. Blow up enemies. Reach the goal. Rarely is time really an issue - if you go really quickly, you can get an extra bonus. So again it's not that it's \"frantic\" - it's just a puzzle to solve. The sound is OK - as I mentioned, I really found some of the sounds quite annoying. I'd much rather just turn off the sound completely and play with my own stereo playing. For graphics, on one hand they are quite impressive for a handheld. The little flowers blow in the wind, there are little flying birds, the stained glass windows are lovely. On the other hand, there are many situations where you can't see what you're supposed to do, even when you spin the map. It's hard to tell what you can move and what you can't, where you can go. The design is lovely, but not always functional. Another minor but annoying thing is that your characters are all teen boys. Surely they could have given you a female character to go box-pushing? For me, the really shining part of this game is the movie that comes with it. It's a real animated short movie with a TON of funny scenes in it. Make sure that you watch it, from the main menu.

With Myst IV Revelation, you have TWO DVDs full of gaming information. This takes up 8 GIG on your hard drive for a full install. It is massive. Yes, as you can imagine, the graphics are gorgeous. Birds fly over to the birdfeeder as you watch, and then flit off. The water ripples beneath you. The clouds drift by. The art nouveau architecture is simply gorgeous, and each world has its own culture. It is a visual feast. The sounds are equally immersive. Peter Gabriel did some of the sound. The audio track not only draws you into the world, but also gives you clues, if you listen carefully to what sounds you are hearing in which locations. But how is the *gameplay*? I am a huge, huge fan of the Myst series so I have to say, if you're patient, the game is really fun. But you can't expect to just zip through the game quickly. The point is to sit with a glass of wine, roaming around, clicking on things, exploring your world. There is a lot of trial and error before you discover what the next puzzle is - and then a lot of twiddling before you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, the very first puzzle, of lining up audio wave signals, is REALLY annoying. The helper is trying to give you assistance but most of the time his comments strike you as quite intrusive. It's not a puzzle at all that will \"make sense\" to most people. I am actually an audio buff and my boyfriend is a musician who plays with audio files, and even so we found the controls and setup hard to work with. This would have been find as an end-game puzzle, but it is awful as the way to get people into the game in the first place. The other subsequent puzzles are much more enjoyable and logical. I wanted to pick up all sorts of things, and got frustrated that I could see books and not read them. You could never tell which pieces of paper were readable and which were mysteriously glued to the table.  The amulet that you pick up is fun, giving you visions and sounds to help you move the plot along. However it blinks pretty much ANY time you zoom in on things. Why not just have it show you the video automatically the first time, and let you click on it after that to replay the video? The constant click - zoom - click - amulet got a bit much. Especially when the video was on the meaningless side. I really would have hoped that by now the game would be \"fully motion\" enabled. In the first myst, you in essence walked through paintings. You could only look at the screen and then click to go somewhere else. You couldn't turn and rotate. Through Myst II-IV we got more and more video, first as tiny integrations and then as full screens. But while we can \"look around us\" in Myst IV, you still have to click and wait to move your feet. Maybe Myst V will actually let you walk. It's that clicking that begins to wear on me, the click, wait, click, wait. The quick-hop ability to leap to certain spots does help, but I would rather be able to move seamlessly through my world. That all being said, Myst IV is definitely a must-have for any puzzle lover. The graphics and sounds are gorgeous, and the puzzles are challenging and fun. I do have a walkthrough online but please do NOT use walkthroughs until you are really stuck. The point of this game is not to race through and be done. The point is to enjoy the world, to immerse yourself and to try, try, try and finally succed at the puzzle in front of you.</td><td>Massive requirements but amazing puzzle gameplay</td><td>1097539200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>46259</td><td>4.0</td><td>14</td><td>false</td><td>10 12, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00009KX7C</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Aliens vs Predator Extinction is a StarCraft style game pitting the human marines against the classic sci-fi monsters Aliens and Predators. Three separate campaigns await! There are 7 missions per group, and 20 maps that you explore. Sometimes you are the marines, trying to defend your base against the onslaught of nasties. Sometimes you are the aliens, carefully tending to your nest of eggs and developing a new queen. Each group has its own growth trees, its advancements and goals. The graphics are good but not excellent. The maps are sometimes quite on the plain side - endless caves, endless jungles. The sound is reasonably good and does give you a spooky feeling sometimes, worrying what might be around the next corner. None of the groups are easy to play, and the game is definitely not an arcade-style shoot-em-up. You have to lay down a well thought out strategy, using each of your unit types to its best advantage, if you're going to win. Anyone who has seen the movies knows that whatever side you're on, there are usually overwhelming odds stacked up against you that usually leave only one man standing. The game is no exception. Don't expect an easy mow-down-the-enemy game. Whichever side you play, you're going to have to play WELL to move along. I realize that plots are usually rather transparent in these games, but I do still like them. I was disappointed with the plot and cutscenes in here - you get a brief 'do this' description in the beginning and if you win, you win. I would really have loved some cinematics to show what was happening and to give you a sense of satisfaction when you win the game. To just have it say \"OK, campaign done.\" wasn't very much fun after many hours of playing. Probably the most disappointing part was the complete lack of multiplay. We often have friends over the house to play games with us, and this one was a sit-and-watch game only. You can't multiplay in the same house. You can't multiplay over XBox Live. And since there are only 7 missions per group, once you finish those missions, the game is completely over. That's rather short for us - we enjoy games that we play for months and months, unlocking new features and missions and playing multiplay. To have a game that just ends after a week of play seems rather short. A great game for a sci-fi and StarCraft style strategy fan, but be ready to sell it back to the game store for their used shelves when you're done.</td><td>Fun but Very Short</td><td>1065916800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>34490</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 12, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000066TS5</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The new hit game Kingdom Hearts for the PlayStation 2 combines the great characters of Final Fantasy VII, VIII and X with Disney Favorites! Many gamers will be unsure about this game at first. Disney characters? You mean little Mickeys and Minnies in a game? Really, give it a chance. The game can be played by those under 10, but it's captivating for teenagers and adults too! First, the graphics are just AMAZING. The characters are all amazingly rendered. From Donald Duck to Goofy with their curves, to Tidus and Wakka from FFX and Selphie from FFVIII and more. There are different textures in each world, from the Jungle planet of Tarzan to the rooms and gardens of Alice in Wonderland, to the Coliseum of Olympus. They're all lovingly rendered in gameplay, and the cutscenes are gorgeous. Next, plot and gameplay. The 'heartless' have come to attack the various worlds, and you must investigate to figure out what is going on. There are many quests on each planet, all quite fun and logical. There are other cross-world quests, such as finding all 99 Dalmatian puppies or tracking down missing pages in a journal. Your main character, \"Sora\", can be with Donald, Goofy, Tarzan, and other characters during these quests. In addition, he learns the ability to get help from other characters, such as Dumbo the Elephant. There is a lot of puzzle solving, but also a lot of combat as you fight off the shadow creatures. You get to choose your character type in the beginning - warrior, guardian or mystic. You also get to shape your personality by answering three questions about what you treasure in life, what you fear, and what you hope for. You level up as you go along, getting more strength and more skills. There are normal and hard settings, so you can set it to normal for the kids in the house and set it to hard for those looking for more of a challenge. There are a lot of witty references in the game that adults will be sure to love, and the younger ones will be happy seeing goofy and pluto protecting the land from the enemy. Final Fantasy players have always loved the romance that weaves through the FF series, and Kingdom Hearts provides that as well. Sora is in love with Kairi, and she is lost at the beginning of the game. So part of his quest is to find her and protect her. The scenes of him sitting on the dock by the ocean talking with her, as the sun sets slowly, are simply beautiful.

This mature title has got puzzles, RPG, chess, and yes, lots of bloody Kombat! The traditional aspects of Mortal Kombat are here. You have different characters to choose from. Different styles of fighting. Key combinations create gorgeous attack moves. You earn coins as you go, to spend on unlocking new characters, levels, and other secrets. The graphics here are simply gorgeous. The floors and walls have textures from shiny and reflective to grainy matte. The glow of fire, misty mountains and glowing lights are quite impressive. Characters have robes that flow with the action and accessories that sway realistically. If you want to be gory, the blood even flows down your body. On the other hand, in Dead or Alive the environments are amazingly reactive - fighting in a snowy area leaves tracks in the snow, and autumn leaves blow past you in the forest. In comparison, Mortal Kombat has a desert island fight seem like the ground is made of concrete. So there is still room for improvement. Body movements are equally as well done. Gone are the days of blocky characters with jerky attacks. You can really feel like you're in a martial arts movie here, with the super smooth blocks and combo kicks. This is great for the audience the game is intended for (mature) - but means that youngsters can easily get upset by some of the very realistic back-breaking moves. There's a reason this game earned that mature rating. Even the sub-games are so good that they could easily qualify as standalone packages. The Puzzle Kombat is in essence tetris with fighting animations for when you do well. Chess Kombat is chess with little mortal kombat pieces. You can play both of these on XBox Live too! There's also a Konquest Adventure where you wander around talking to characters and taking on quests. Highly recommended for mature fighting game fans, and with all of the things to unlock you have great incentive to play for weeks and weeks to see everything.</td><td>Great graphics and fighting fun for mature audiences</td><td>1097452800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>52216</td><td>5.0</td><td>33</td><td>false</td><td>10 11, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000VSH2W</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Yu Yu Hakusho Dark Tournament is based on an anime series. Yusuke Urameshi, the main character, is a 14 year old. He was killed and brought back to life, and now is able to see ghosts. The game puts Yusuke into an arena tournament fighting situation, with the familiar friends and foes from the show. There is a training mode to help you get started, and skirmish mode to practice your moves. Then there are arcade and dark tournament modes to get you into actual gameplay, moving through levels of difficulty. You can't really compare the graphics in this game to other fighting games like Mortal Kombat. The point of Dark Tournament is to feel like you're immersed in the Yu Yu Hakusho world, and it does this quite nicely. The anime style and backgrounds are all very much of the Yu Yu Hakusho style. There are several different arenas to fight in, and many characters to choose from. Each character has his or her own style and look. In addition to the basic fighting game, there is also a built in \"token game\". You earn tokens when you fight. You then move to the token game to use them. The token game is very much like a strategy card game, using a hexagonal based board. This addition makes the overall game much more long term. You have incentive to keep fighting, to earn tokens. Then in the token game you can build up your token stash to do better and better. Definitely a game that any Yu Yu Hakusho fan will love, and play for a long time!</td><td>Great fun for Yu Yu Hakusho Fans</td><td>1097452800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>58477</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 11, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0002HDT0O</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>If you're looking for a fighting game that is more stylistic than realistic, Guilty Gear X2 might be the one for you. Anime characters use magic and swords to become victorious. The anime is lovely, with bursts of smoke and blasts of light highlighting the combat. The background on this side-scroller is stationary, with the exceptions of an occasional walking cat or twitching plant. There isn't as much blood here as in other games, but of course the aim of beating another character into submission is rather violent :) The game has a teen rating. Rock music blasts in the background as you fight in one of several gameplay options. There are arcade-style sequences of battles, or the MOM instant-battle to earn points. There's a mission mode to go through a series of assigned tasks, and story mode to learn more about a particular character and his/her background. The game has a great selection of girls, guys and robots to choose from, which is nice to see in a fighting game.  Anime fans will also love the artwork you can see throughout the game, to give inspiration for your own drawing projects. Perhaps the only real complaint I have with this arcade-style anime fighting fest is the music. The loud, repetitive blasting gets very wearying after a while. If they'd used a great band, it could really have added to the experience. Still, I know some people who don't mind the music at all, so depending on your personal tastes you might like or dislike it. Luckily, the game lets you set the volume for backgrond music, voice and special effects separately. Just change the settings to suit your taset.

This handheld device is about the size of a GBA and has a great MP3 player, cellphone, address book, calendar, FM radio, web browser and more! People who look at and judge this device solely as a \"GBA SP contender\" are missing the point. This system is more like a super-charged palm pilot than a GBA SP. You can surf the web from it, share images with friends, give them a call when you're running late, look up your calendar appointments, and then play a game of Super Monkey Ball or tetris while you wait at the doctor's! First, the size. The screen on the Nokia is a bit smaller than the GBA SP but no different than most handhelds. It is very crisp and bright, very easy to read. The GBA SP has a lot of 'wasted space' but the Nokia is actually well designed - easy access to the MP3 area, radio and main menu. Buttons to make calls are right up on top, and the gaming controls are raised and easy to get to. The graphics are quite sharp. The two games I'm addicted to right now are Super Monkey Ball (just about exactly the same as the GameCube version) and Puyo Pop which is a jazzed up Tetris game. Both are fun to play with voices, music and graphics. The various menus to get to your notepad, calendar, calculator, etc. are customizeable and easy to use. The radio works very well and brings in radio stations easily, letting you set favorites and give them names. The MP3 system works off of memory cards that are shared with the Otis and other MP3 devices - the USB cable lets you move playlists on and off your PC. The sound both through the headphones and through the built-in speakers is clear and strong. A few people have complained that you look \"silly\" holding this system to your head to make calls. So wait, they're spending $300 on a PDA system that can browse the web, play games, and play music - and their concern is about \"looking cool\" in front of their friends? Making phone calls is a normal part of life - it's not a catwalk on a runway! On one hand, yes $300 is a lot of money. But on the other hand I own a cell phone, a GBA SP, a portable radio, a high-end MP3 player, a Palm Pilot and have paid for currency converters and other add-on software. It is a ROYAL pain when we go on motorcycle trips or trips over to Europe to carry 8 different devices, worry about charging them and keeping the batteries stocked. When we're traveling we use the radio for weather updates, the MP3 to play books-on-tape, the palm pilot for hotel information, calendars and currency converters, the cell phone to call ahead and let people know when we're arriving. When we have down-time, we play the games and enjoy the relaxation. This Nokia is PERFECT for those tasks. One device to charge, no batteries to buy, small size, easy to use. My two complaints with the system both involve the games. One is that there aren't many out right now - but that is normal for any brand new release. The second is that to change games you have to take out the battery. But I don't tend to game-swap every 15 seconds - I'll play a game for quite a while before moving on to a new one. So neither issues are huge for me. If you're a new-game-every-10-minutes person you might get tired of changing the cartridges constantly. In general, if all you're after is a game-player to play Mario 24 hours a day, and don't own a cell phone, MP3 player, calendar, radio, or any other device, then this might not be the system for you. Just stick with your GBA SP and enjoy. But if you DO own one or several of the other devices, I highly recommend grabbing a Nokia and giving your other devices away to your friends. After a short while you'll wonder why you used to bother filling your pockets with 10 different devices, when this one N-gage can do it all!</td><td>A great multi-function device that plays games too!</td><td>1065830400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>41232</td><td>5.0</td><td>13</td><td>false</td><td>10 11, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00007LVJC</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Let's see - this computer game involves 2 plumbers who get wrapped up in world-changing plots. There's an evil group out to destroy things as we know it, and a beautiful girl in trouble. Sound familiar? Nope, it's not Super Mario X. Instead, this is the start for Freedom Fighters, set in an alternate reality of New York City. In this version, the Russians are taking over the world and have just reached your metropolis home. The graphics on this game are simply amazing. It's more of a cel shaded high-end cartoon feel than a realistic one, but the facial expressions and movements are dead on. You move through various areas of New York - Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the landscapes and buildings are very well done. You move through movie theaters, churches and more, and as the game progresses they turn into more and more of a war zone. Escape from New York was just the beginning. The gameplay is great. You start out as an 'average Joe' - but as your search for your brother continues, and you get involved in the resistance movement, your character wears more gear, knows the ins-and-outs more, and draws more followers. At first you only have 2 people believing in you, but as you prove yourself you can recruit more and more followers to help you out. The sound effects and music are excellent. The ambient noise are right on, giving you a sense that you really are under fire in a dirty New York street. The music is rich, Russian epic, giving you the sense that a gigantic empire is rolling across the world, and you are a mere toothpick in its path. The AI and gamplay is superb. Your teammages take cover, peer around corners, provide covering fire, take over machine guns when they're available. You can tell them to advance to a given point, or 'scout an area', or follow behind you, so depending on your gameplay style you can be as specific as general as you wish. There are helicopters that chase you down, APCs that bring reinforcements, buildings to run around in, streets to terrorize. There are turned-over cars, barbed wire fences and everything inbetween. The in-game maps are incredible and the physics are very realistic. Having been in New York many times and having a boyfriend who grew up there, the atmosphere is dead on. Highly recommended for any strategy-war fan who really enjoys a game that envelops you. This isn't an arcade blood-and-guts fest. The game lets you heal your teammates, build a reputation and make a stand to protect your home and your family. Just about the only thing this is missing is multiplayer. We can only hope that a future release will add that in, and make this a true gaming classic.</td><td>May be a cliche, but an amazingly well done one!</td><td>1065830400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>52847</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>10 10, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>0006176070</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Carole King is simply an amazing songwriter and singer that pours her emotion and being in each song. You can hear her hurt, her pain, and her hope. This isn't a helpless, please come and rescue me princess. She's going to stand on her own two feet and try to get through life as best as she can. On it's too late she says right out, one of us has changed, or maybe we've just stopped trying. I really connect with So Far Away, the angst of being apart from those you love. Sometimes it's distance that separates you - but sometimes it's time. You've Got a Friend of course is another true classic. We've all been there, sad and depressed. We've all wanted someone to just come and hold us, and tell us it's going to be better soon. She has that voice of someone you can trust, someone you can turn to. While Natural Woman is a nice power song that speaks to every woman out there, I still have to vote for Tapestry as being my favorite on this set.

You're not a secret agent, nor a tough-talking street punk. Instead, you are Rico Rodriguez - smooth, suave, and probably decked out in rich Corinthian leather. The island map you explore is HUGE, made up of many smaller sub-islands with roads, jungles, bridges, coastlines, and tons of villages. Everything is a mix of bright, tropical colors and run down, Cuban / Haitian slums. Compared to some of the grey, dreary games on the market, you might think the colors here are too cartoony. However, if you're ever lucky enough to visit the Caribbean, you'll realize that the sea really *is* that blue ... the lush jungles are really a brilliant green. That's not to say you're in an eden here. Rico has been brought in by the CIA to mingle with the local revolutionaries to topple a corrupt government. You're not bound by many laws while you do this. You quickly start stealing cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters and anything else that strikes your fancy. You can hop into the back of open trucks, ride along on the top of moving vehicles, and do numerous 'stunt moves' to carry out your missions with flair. You have a magical unlimited parachute pack on, so any time you find yourself falling into trouble, POOF your parachute opens up and you sail to safety. This definitely enjoys its action movie lack of realism with great gusto. The cliches abound, as does the peppered-with-key-words Hispanic dialogue.  There are numerous side missions - find the 10 boxes of coca. Find the 10 sniper scopes that were washed ashore. I had both good and not-so-good feelings about the graphics. On one hand, they dida good job of showing the run down nature of many of the towns, the style of cars available, the vegetation. But on the other hand, we have seen some awesome graphics on our XBox 360 - and this just wasn't up to the same quality level. Many items in nature seemed blocky. The shadows were often jagged. I suppose it's a trade-off - they created a HUGE world, far larger than pretty much any other game I've seen - so perhaps the detail in that massive world wasn't quite up to other games. I think I personally would have rather had a smaller world - so you weren't running across vast empty wastelands to get to destinations - and kicked the graphic quality up a bit. Still, there is a lot to enjoy here. There are a ton of vehicles, a ton of locations, and lots of main and side missions to work on.

The game helps to teach you the skills necessary to care for a pet! There are three different types of Nintendog games out there - Chihuahua, Dachshund, and Labrador Retriever. Each game has a different group of dog breeds available in it. If you get all 3 games you get the full collection of dog types - but there are plenty enough to choose from with just one game. You start out by choosing a dog and naming it. The simple interactions come first of course - tossing a tennis ball, petting the dog, teaching it to sit. Your pet learns to respond to your voice commands, and develops a personality depending on how you interact with it. You take your pet for walks, feed it, give it water, and most of all provide it with love and affection. As you progress with your pet, you can teach it more tricks, play frisbee with it and enter it in a variety of competitions. You can earn money, buy new treats for your pup, and even customize the home you live in. If you have other Nintendo DS owners in your area, you can even share pet time together and exchange information! I've played many pet games before this one - Catz, Dogz, Creatures, NeoPets, you name it. It's impressive how far the graphics have come in these games. The Nintendog pet is very emotive - from the hopeful eyes to the wagging tail, you really get a sense that this is a live creature anxious for affection. You can pet the pup, nuzzle it under the chin, tickle its belly.  When you throw the ball or toss the frisbee, it really reacts the way you would think it should. It's delightful to see a game that doesn't involve violence or destruction. Sure, if you neglect your pet it will get upset. But in general, you can go as slowly as you wish, caring for your pet, knowing that it will unashamedly love you back completely. There are millions of people out there who simply cannot have a real pet. Some are allergic to pets, some have tiny apartments where there is not enough room for a pet. Some kids are simply too young for a real pet and have parents who will not take on the responsibility. There are many, many reasons that a real pet would be impossible - and the Nintendog is the perfect solution!

I was blown away in so many ways. We have all the various music games, many for several platforms, and this by far is our new favorite. First, of course, the music. We have always loved the Beatles and playing through this game just reminds us how amazing these guys were as musicians. There's the \"outliers\" theory that they had amassed 10,000 hours of playing time with their high intensity early years, which speaks to their superb ability to just pick up and run on any stage. Whatever it was, their harmonies are superb, their rhythms are great fun. Bob (my musician boyfriend) commented that playing along with the songs was great. Often we have to force ourselves to play through a song on other games (even songs we like) because the coded buttons just aren't enjoyable, the coders get the rhythm a bit off. Here I was dancing along while I played guitar or sang. There are 8 chapters / venues, from the Cavern up through the Apple roof-top. There are three Abbey Road studio chapters. You might think that's boring. However, it was *superb*. They might start a song in the studio, but then the visuals go off to a CUSTOM TAILORED TO THAT SONG video! The Yellow Submarine song is underwater. The Sgt Pepper's song is in the gazebo complete with 1800s cut-out people! The flower sequences are amazing. Usually in music games I ignore the backgrounds. Here I would miss notes because I was swept away by the background graphics! Whoever did these art collaborations needs to be given a bottle of Champagne. Maybe two. They were incredibly beautiful and a sheer perfect tie-in with the songs many times. I would gladly watch someone else play so I could watch the visuals. Yes the \"gig\" shows you get early are fun - period appropriate screaming fans at Shea Stadium. I have to comment that the audience at the Budokan looked completely caucasian, surely some non-causasians should have been there? Still, a minor complaint. Gameplay is as mentioned superbly fun, and not just because of the stellar music. You get real harmonies, which is a breakthrough for these main pair of products (GH and RB). Sing along in harmony with a friend, sometimes even three part harmony. If you have a mic stand you can even hook up your mic and play drums while you sing, play guitar while you sing, since there's no \"hand clapping\" or other stuff you have to do. There are a few minor complaints. I nailed 100% several times and got nothing at all. No gold stars, no visual indication. Since I like to go through and get 100% on all songs, there's no easy way to see which to replay. The between-gig navigation is a bit rough, you have to literally page through them so you can't just scan the list. Even when you're looking at a given gig you have to go \"in\" to the gig to see which specific songs to work on. I really like having a scan option so I can look through for what I want to play with. You earn photos with your stars (i.e. actual photos of the Beatles to look at) but I'd have liked something a little more fun.  More instruments? I realize they want their gigs to all be period-specific with the right instruments and clothes but it still would have been cool to give the option. Also, you are forced down their path in its completeness. You can't get past the Cavern until you play EVERY gig in it. Then you move on to the Ed Sullivan show and so on. In every case you have to play every single song. I'd really like to have the normal \"earn X stars and progress\" in case there's  a song you're really eager to get to. You do get to download additional songs if you want - so if the killer set list built into this game isn't enough, you can always get more! I want to comment in general that the equipment you have for playing any of these music games matters a LOT. We have the Ion drum kit and the wireless guitars. I highly, highly recommend getting both of these. Playing any of these music games (and especially the Beatles!) on cheap gear can really frustrate you quickly.  Spend the money to get better equipment. You'll find you play the games for months and months because they are so much fun. You'll also find that your real life dexterity and drumming skills will improve *amazingly*. Finally be sure to sit through the 10 minute long (I'm not kidding) credits. You get to unlock an encore :) Feel free to contact me with any questions at all! I have the full set list posted on my site. UPDATE: Several people have emailed me asking if this can be played single player. YES. You play single player through the entire game if you wish. Also, if you're alone in your house, you can still play multi-player with people on Live, so you can have fun four player music by going online and finding other players through the Live network.</td><td>Fantastic, Amazing game - or should I say Fabulous!</td><td>1252454400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>40814</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>09 8, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00007JZB3</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Tron 2.0 is a computer game that lets you enjoy many different types of gameplay, from shooting to puzzles and racing!

It features enhanced graphics and additional gameplay. I love the Ninja Gaiden series in general, and definitely wanted to play Ninja Gaiden Sigma. It features new areas and lets you play as Rachel. I like how they toss you right into the gameplay without a tedious tutorial forced-play. You're leaping up walls, vaulting over enemies, and slashing your way through tatami-filled rooms. It feels quite visceral and thrilling to be hacking away at ninja enemies while working your way towards your objective. The graphics are reasonably good, although certainly not perfect. There were ample times where I clipped through a wall or a body or blood stain did something not quite physically possible. The game ensures that you can't just button mash your way to victory. You have to be deft with your jumping, blocking, and different styles of attacks to make it past the enemies. Some of them are quite challenging. At times it seems like they have thousands of enemies hiding behind one single wall, just streaming out at you endlessly. I do have to give a special thumbs-down to their camera. Certainly complaining about bad cameras is almost a given in gaming reviews. Camera angles can be quite annoying. But even knowing how bad cameras have been in other games, Ninja Gaiden Sigma has serious faults here. There have been ample times that I *should* have won a combat sequence but the bizarre twist of the camera made it impossible to know what to do. The game also loves to mis-interpret your commands. You can be hacking away at an enemy and doing a near-perfect job of taking them down - but get too close to a chest and the game decides that this is the ideal time for you to sit down and read a complex scroll on how to do a new move. Ah, no. I had no intention of opening that chest. I was in the middle of fighting for my life. Still, the game is immensely fun. I enjoy the levels and the enemies. Well recommended to ninja-style fans who are up for a challenge. Rating: 8/10 I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.</td><td>Challenging Ninja Fun</td><td>1346976000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>199751</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>09 7, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B002CZ38KA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Heavy Rain is touted as being \"interactive drama\" - a game defined primarily by story and choices, rather than combat. While the degree of \"interactivity\" may be questionable, there's no doubt that as a game this represents an entirely new genre - not quite open-ended, but still offering results for the player's actions. Heavy Rain tells the story of four characters: The single father, Ethan, the detective, Scott, the journalist, Madison, and the FBI agent, Norman. Their stories are told as short vignettes - the perspective will start at Ethan, switch to Scott, then to Norman, and so on as the story warrants. Their stories center around the Origami Killer, a serial killer so named because of the figures he leaves on his victims. Each character is trying to investigate the killer for different reasons, and while their investigations start out entirely separate they inexorably end up caught up in each others' stories. The game is carried out through what are basically quick-time events. In some segments, the player character will be allowed to walk around and interact with their environment by making the appropriate movement when near an object. In action sequences, the player simply has to hit the buttons (or do the appropriate motions) when the icon for it pops up. Both try to have actions be fairly intuitive based on the motion. The game's use of occasional motion controls, as well as making the button display shakier in times of stress or crisis, both add atmosphere and player connection to the events of the game. The game's \"choice\" varies between the two kinds of sequences. In free-moving sequences, the player is allowed to make an occasional decision that will affect the development or ending of the game. In action sequences, the player's goal is simply to survive - messing up too many quick-time events (or one important one) will actually kill the character off permanently. For that reason, there's always a really impressive sense of weight and drama during these scenes, instead of annoyance or irritation on having to retry if you fail. There's a chapter select, so it's possible to go back and retry failed scenes, but the real drama of the game comes from trying to get it all done on one playthrough without having any characters die or do the wrong thing. Personally, I became more concerned for my success than I had in any other game simply because of this fact. The main problem I could see with the game is that, while the game's a murder mystery, you're never really given the opportunity to try and solve it per se. While you, the player, might guess at it based on clues you find, there's no part of the game that's actually about going out and getting clues. The characters investigate, but in a linear, pre-determined manner. While on the one hand I found this kind of annoying, the fact that the game has to go on no matter who dies - even if all the playable characters die - kind of balanced it out. There's simply so many scenarios already that making it open-ended on top of that would've been much more difficult. On the whole I really enjoyed Heavy Rain, primarily because of the aforementioned life-or-death struggles. However, it was only really good for one playthrough - it's not the kind of game that one really replays to find out what happened. The game is about your one story, and going back and doing it again takes away a lot of the pressure, and therefore the drama, of the game's system. It's essentially an extended movie where the player's failure can change the ending. It's worth a playthrough, but might not be worth holding onto. 8/10.

We are both musicians. So we definitely were looking forward to Guitar Hero 5 to see what new features it would offer and how it would compare with the many other offerings that exist out there. First, let me comment that it makes a HUGE difference what equipment you use for any of these games. If your drums suck, then it really doesn't matter what the game does or does not do. You're going to hate the experience because of lousy drum response. So we definitely recommend having wireless guitars, so there's no drag at all on your movements, and an Ion drum kit. Making these improvements in your set are going to give you a vastly superior experience whichever game you go with. Guitar Hero 5 doesn't do anything groundbreakingly new. We were able to pop it in and start playing on Medium, whipping through songs at 5 stars without much problem. So the mechanics are sound. Hit colored notes with the matching button. Sing on key. The songs are all \"real songs\" by now which is great - no more fake-bands with not-right notes. You can import other songs from past games (in the same series) which is good too. They've done some nice work with the interface. Each player gets their own view of the fail bar so you can see at a glance how well you're doing, and how you're earning star power. Activating star power implements it just for you, which I disagree with. I think a member should be able to help the entire band. That's always been a complaint of mine with this series though. They are focusing now solely on stars. You earn up to five stars for performance, one for perfection, and then others through cool challenges. One song might be \"hit lots of chords\". Another song might be \"hit lots of snares\". It encourages you to go back and replay songs to get those challenge levels, and to try different instruments. The overall interface for working with songs is less than stellar though. When you're in a given gig (location) you can't easily see all the songs. When you're on the overall list of gigs, you can't easily see which gigs still have songs to do. If you're poking into a given gig to look around, when you come back out it resets you back to your \"current gig\". The whole moving around the screens is a pain. The character customization is lacking. I'm female and I found the outfits for women to be on the insulting side. In other games I can create PERFECT outfits that I adore. Here it seems I have to choose from leather bikinis, spiked bikinis or plastic bikinis. I was hard pressed to find something I even remotely liked. The tutorials are also lacking. The drum star power for example says to use the orange cymbal - which we don't have on an ion drum kit. So we did the tutorial which properly showed us as not having an orange track - but then told us to hit the orange cymbal. We went through the tutorial and it said \"good job\" even though we'd never actually implemented star power!! What kind of a tutorial says you've succeeded when you've failed? They did add some cool features to the locations. For example I was playing \"Jailbreak\" in the Grease drag-strip location. When the song gets to the parts with the sirens, blue and red lights started flashing - and then a burst of flame came out in perfect time to the main crescendo!! Someone did a lot of work with that sort of timing on songs. It really is quite fun if you look for it. It's always hard to critique a song list. Some people will love these songs - other people will hate them. I do like that if you're reasonably good you can unlock new gigs VERY quickly so you can get to fresh songs. That way whichever ones you don't like, you can move past them and get some new ones. That being said, I found fewer songs I adored in this set than perhaps in any other similar game I've played. Maybe this particular one is skewed towards a musical type I'm just not fond of. Some classics are great fun - Sympathy for the Devil, Sultans of Swing - but many of them are not high on my list. I'm sure those exact same songs are high on other peoples' lists. Just be sure to look through the music list and see if it appeals to you. I found the very obvious product placements - like GIANT T-Mobile billboards in the middle of a gig location - to be on the obnoxious side. Surely they could have been done more subtly. In summary, we're certainly enjoying playing it. The tie-ins with the gig location reacting to a specific song is quite cool. The playing of the music is intuitive and fun. But for me, the characters being not ones I really connect with (due to clothing options) and the song list being weighted (for me) with songs I'm not really fond of gives this only 4 stars rather than 5. Feel free to contact me with any questions. As mentioned, we play these games a LOT. NOTE: One more thing to mention! This game was made on SHODDY GAME DISCS and will often give failure messages in older XBox systems. What you have to do is go into the XBox system console and copy the game onto your hard drive. It should run fine once you do that.</td><td>Good Features and a Few Issues</td><td>1252281600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>90403</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 6, 2012</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000H6FUX4</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 for the Wii lets you take on a massive amount of characters in fairly anime-realistic fighting. A must-have for any fan of the series. While the game claims to have over 100 characters, really this just includes multiple versions of the same character. still, it's a fairly impressive number of characters that you get to fight with. The Wii controller and nunchuck are both required, but they let you customize the way your characters fight. Gone are the days where you're button-mashing X X X to make a character do something. Now you're using both hands, combinations of buttons, and it feels far more intuitive. It's actually as if you are that character, blocking and fighting your way to victory. There's a lot of space to work with. One moment you're up on a high plain, and the next moment you're down underwater, blasting away at your enemy. The large amount of space makes you feel as if you really are taking on the battle and unconstrained by artificial restraints. Sure, sometimes you run into a \"wall\" - but most of the time you're free to fly high and delve low in order to take on your enemy. It's probably fair to say that if you're not already indoctrinated into the Dragonball Z that you might be confused. The game throws you right in with characters, situations, and relationships and expects you to understand them. But if you're a fan of the series, you'll love seeing your favorite characters and taking on battles that you've dreamed about. Clearly this is a fighting game. So if you're a fan of fighting games, and a fan of Dragonball Z, you'll be in seventh heaven. If you don't enjoy fighting games, this probably won't convince you to convert. If you're completely oblivious to Dragonball Z, you'll probably be confused. With those two caveats, I do highly recommend this for the Dragonball Z fans out there who want to immerse themselves in some fighting fun.</td><td>Great Fan Immersion</td><td>1346889600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>171899</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>09 6, 2012</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B001CRQYBO</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Essentially a reboot of a reboot, 2009's \"Wolfenstein\" for the XBOX 360 is a largely failed attempt to breathe a third life into the Wolfenstein franchise. Like the previous games in the series, \"Wolfenstein\" places you in the role of the American agent B.J. Blazkowicz, fighting Nazis in World War 2. Also like previous games, the Nazis have access to supernatural technology and super-science. \"Wolfenstein\" takes place in the fictional town of Isenstadt, where Germans are digging through ruins to locate magical crystals. These crystals hold the secrets of creating powerful new weapons and summoning monsters - the usual shtick in these sorts of games. \"Wolfenstein\" is a mix of actual \"levels\" and a very limited form of hub-world. There are three \"factions\" in the world, though ultimately they're all working against the Germans: the resistance, the black market, and the researchers. There are very light RPG elements in the form of weapon upgrades, but they're relatively simple overall. The biggest change gameplay-wise is the medallion B.J. acquires, which allows him to use several different magical powers against his foes. These powers are \"seeing into the Veil\" (which reveals secret doors and magical enemies), slowing down time, creating force fields, and making one's attacks more damaging. In essence, there's nothing really \"special\" or \"unique\", but it's at least an attempt to break from standard shooter conventions (albeit not a particularly good one). The actual shooter controls are pretty iffy. They're not really terrible per se, but they're far from good. While there's some interesting sci-fi guns later on, most of the early parts are lackluster WW2 weapons that just don't leave a particularly good impression. Overall the game is just sort of bland - there's nothing about it that's like \"this is a particularly good part\" or anything, it just meanders along and ends up not going anywhere. Not really worth playing. Rating: 5/10.

He's a big, green timebomb - and he's ticking. As you might tell from the game's intro message, this isn't about a \"good superhero going out and facing down evil badguy\". In fact, the training mission has you as a soldier in a VR environment, learning about the Hulk's moves in order to learn how to defeat the Hulk. As you move through the game, you get a general storyline about the Hulk, but really, that isn't what the game is about. The game is about destruction. Where other games have touted their ability to have a \"fully utilized environment\", the Hulk delivers very nicely. Just about anything you see around you - cars, tankers, even moving people and cows - can be used as a weapon. Chase down the cow, grab it (with its legs waving wildly) and toss it at the enemy soldiers. Pick up the missile truck and lob it at the helicopter. The buildings can be damaged and destroyed. You can leap amazing distances and lob even very heavy items a quite long way. The results are often spectacular. The graphics are quite good considering the number of objects that must be fully rendered in all phases of destruction. That is, they can't nicely create a \"painting\" effect knowing that object will always be seen in that exact same shape. The helicopters are a little blocky, but you can grab them, dent them, fling them at each other, and so on. The sound is reasonably good - really, all you hear is BASH! SMASH! GRRRROWL! plus a few voices saying things like \"he's coming!\" and some Banner conversations. It's good enough to keep the game going, and the musical score is low key and rumbling. You can unlock artworks, move along through missions, and expand the storyline. Really, though, you are primarily destroying things with great glee. You can fling soldiers at trucks. Fling cows at building. Jump up and smash rooftops. Take down towers. Destroy, destroy, destroy. While this isn't a complex puzzle game, there are times in life where you want to put your brain on hold and get rid of stress. Some people go jogging. Some punch punching bags. With the Hulk game, it doesn't matter if it's raining or snowing outside. You can sit down for an hour or two, demolish a ton of things, and accomplish goals along the way. Think of it as a construction worker who has to tear down the old, broken-down building to make room for new apartment buildings. It's destruction with a purpose, and sometimes that can be great fun!</td><td>Fun destruction can relieve stress</td><td>1125792000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>6453</td><td>5.0</td><td>32</td><td>false</td><td>09 4, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000296O5</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I hate to admit it, but I used to think Final Fantasy was just a  hack-and-slash series. I finally did some research into the series, and was  amazed by what I read about FF8. I went out and bought a copy right away to  see what it had to offer. I was extremely impressed. Usually games offer  something to adults, or to kids, but rarely do they get a combination that  intrigues both. This has a training system that makes you figure out which  kind of fighter you wish to be, what you want to earn points towards, how  you want to talk to people, and which of your friends make the best allies  against a certain situation. In addition, an embedded card game series is  quite complex, almost chess like. Often we were hard pressed to beat some  of their masters, but winning the games brought great advantages going  forward. The combat and movement wasn't arcade like, where you had to hit  the joystick just right in Spot A to hit the enemy in Spot B. It mostly was  figuring out the right combination of healing, attacking, and defensive  spells to cast to keep your party alive while taking out the enemy. There  was little if any blood and gore. The aim of the fights was to outsmart  your enemy, not to hack ribbons of flesh off of it. And did I mention the  cinematics? The dance scene in particular stands out in my mind as  completely amazing. I would restart there on purpose to see the detail they  put into the movements. If you love good animation, you could buy the game  just to go from scene to scene. If you enjoy role playing and graphic  adventure games at all, I'd highly recommend this one.

You begin with a  number of islands on the map, and with your flotilla of boats, you explore  them, learning what each is good at producing. You settle on one, creating  hunting lodges, tobacco plantations, sugar cane, chapels, and homes. Just  as in the Caesar III style of games, there are steps to take to create  products. You take tobacco from the farm and turn it into cigars. Sugar  cane goes to the distillery and becomes alcohol, and the tavern buys it.  You can also establish trade routes. An island low in tobacco can ship that  in, and send off the stones it is mining. Homes develop in size as their  needs are met. Quarry stone for more advanced buildings, and build your  technology for more interesting options. Build up your sheep farm and send  wool to the weaver for more content (and well dressed)  inhabitants. There's combat too - pirates lurk in the seas, and nearby  settlements compete with you for land. You can invade their territory, or  try to outmerchant them. You can even multi-play to take on your friends in  high seas adventure. While this is definitely fun for beginners, it  leaves something to be desired for advanced players. I would recommend this  to a family that wishes to play together, and for gamers new to strategy,  who want to learn at a gentle pace how to manage resources and grow a city.</td><td>Great intro for people new to strategy gaming</td><td>968025600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>5206</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 4, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00001SHON</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Strategy games are often games that require you slice your enemy into  bits, blow up his tanks, and mow down his peasants. It's so wonderful to  find a fantastic strategy game that is at its root a monetary war, instead  of a physical one. In Railroad Tycoon II you being with the famous  B&O Railroad, connecting cities in the northeast corridor of the US.  You begin with single track, determining which city needs which goods, and  how to give each city what they want while managing your finances. As you  get more money you can build larger stations, buy bigger engines, beef up  your track system, and more. Cities will offer you money in exchange for  building track out to them, and the more cities you connect, the more types  of goods you have to offer to other stations on the line. As you move on in  the game you can move on to different areas, even building a network of  rails across Europe. You get annual reports with your finances, can  purchase stock in your own company or from competitors. You can buy farms  and factories, invest, take out loans, but if you wish, you can simply ride  the rails and move goods. The graphics are great for a game from '98.  They are done in an organic, old style, with old videos showing events of  the times. You can build telegraph poles to speed station turnaround, hear  about recessions and regrowth of economies, issue bonds, attempt mergers.  The political climate even affects where rights are cheap or expensive to  buy. It's a lesson in history as well as a challenging mental  exercise! Some of the more advanced features are a bit difficult to  figure out, but there are numerous web sites out there that will quickly  guide you through those situations. For most of the game, it's incredibly  easy to learn, and the status screens tell you at a glance what is going  on. You can even customize your own map, and play in another country or  in a mythical situation of your own devising. I recommend this highly as  a great strategy game for all ages that you actually come away with knowing  more than you did when you began.</td><td>Proves strategy doesn't always involve bloodshed</td><td>968025600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>9137</td><td>3.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>09 4, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00002SU5D</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Star Trek games are for some reason notoriously awful. I'm not sure if  developers are intimidated by the fame of the series, or if there simply  aren't very many programmers who can handle the Wing Commander level many  of us gamers expect from a good space game. While Armada is better than  most, it still could be so much more. Yes, you can be one of four groups  - the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans, or the Borg. Each has its own  ships and bases, and special abilities. The graphics are Homeworld-esque -  very lovely, with details on ships and other stellar objects. I grew up  loving Star Trek, and it is neat to be able to manipulate the ships.  However, playing is like sliding miniatures around on a glass tabletop.  Where is the space aspect of this? Scales are not always proper as they  slide from Point A to Point B. You do traditional StarCraft types of  operations - mine your dilithium, build your base, kick out fighting units,  take out the enemy. Instead of choosing an attack stance, you choose the  red/yellow/green alert. Getting into the game is extremely difficult for  new players. The manual itself is not very helpful, and the commands are  not always intuitive. One of our test machines was a P2-266, which they  list as supported, but the machine only ran at the lowest graphic setting  available, choking constantly. Even on faster systems the crash rate is  rather impressive. I really, really wanted to enjoy this as a strategy  game. My love of Trek tried to get me to overlook some of the flaws.  However, no matter how gorgeous the ships themselves and the generated  mid-game cinematics, the AI is simply lacking and the gameplay itself is  nothing special when compared to other strategy games out there. If  you're a Trek lover, grab a copy to play with the ships.

No matter how well it did, people are going to judge its \"wow factor\" against how amazing the original Halo felt to play back when it first came out. Now that we are used to the weapons, races, environments and plotline, nothing is as cool as it was that first time. It's the same issue that plagues any series, be it Dune, the Matrix, Star Wars, etc. Halo 3 does get a boost in that it is released for the 360, so you get an automatic upgrade in abilities there. We're playing on a high end HD TV, and yes, it looks really nice. The backgrounds look like a painting in motion, with swirling clouds and dancing dust storms. From the light glinting off the metal surfaces to the detailed shadows in the rocks, it can be really gorgeous. Is every detail as beautiful as every detail in, say Gears of War? Maybe not. Different developers focus on different items.  There are always trade-offs for speed and visual appeal reasons. For a Halo world, I think they did a good job. The sound and dialogue are really great. I like the background music, and I find much of the dialogue hilarious. There are some conversations that have me laughing out loud. This is a good game to play with your surround sound stereo system hooked up, and of course the subwoofers. I hated the ending of Halo 2. I dislike it when a story finishes with a \"and now wait a few years to find out what happened.\"  They can at least have you feel like you achieved something, and ended a chapter. For that reason alone it's good to have Halo 3 here to wrap everything up. Unfortunately, with all the time they spent in development, this third outing is a bit predictable. I really enjoyed the multi character play in Halo 2. I thought that was a great touch. They completely removed it for Halo 3, setting you back into a Master Chief only mode. To be honest, I really thought we'd get THREE races this time around, and get to play as the Flood too. Why reduce ourselves to just one? Also, while there are a lot of \"missions\", some of them are maybe 5 minutes long. That's a bit on the short side. I realize you can go back and replay on harder and harder levels to challenge yourself - but they could have put more depth into the basic story line. Now, all of those things being said, the key to any game in modern times is its multiplayer ability. No matter what single player game you play, it's pretty much a limited time game. Multiplayer is completely unlimited - and you're not stuck with the formulas built into the AI brains. Halo 3 is definitely the best multiplayer experience of the three games - the most balanced, the most fun, the best graphics. You could literally play this for years and not get bored of it. So to summarize - if you don't have XBox Live, you could rent this game for a week, get through it and have a lot of fun. You'll be able to see how the story ends, get your Halo fix in and be happy. But if you do have XBox Live, you'll want to own this. Between replaying the base game on harder levels to improve your skills, and playing multi-player in a variety of maps and set-ups, you'll be happy for a long, long while. There are many games we write a walkthrough for that we have to push ourselves to get through, but when we did our walkthrough for Halo 3, we really did have fun :) So that's always a good sign!</td><td>A Must-Own - But Not Perfection</td><td>1191110400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>459668</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>09 30, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0002OOUM8</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Dai Senryaku 7 is an old school strategy game, complete with a hexagonal grid map and units to move around the board. Despite the fully 3D intro sequence, once you get into the gameplay it's all flat. You have a seutp screen with very simple graphics, to choose sides and options. Once you're in actual gameplay, you can \"zoom\" above the map, but you're just getting a sideways view on the gameboard. This is similar to Advance Wars. There are different levels of units - tanks, recon vehicles, artillery, boats, aircraft and more. Each unit has a move rate, cost to buy, attack capability, ability to see a certain distance, and so on. With 400+ units, a lot of gameplay comes down to really knowing what your options are and choosing the exact units which will be best for your plans. Maybe you want a lot of fast, long-seeing but low damage units ... or maybe you want a few battlehorses of great strength to march towards victory. The sounds are about as feeble as the graphics. There are a few clicking noises, clacking noises, and a repetitive background song. Still, again it's not about the view or the sound. You could pretty much turn off the sound and play your favorite songs on the stereo while you played. The terrain types are only vaguely hinted at on the hexes ... but that does the job. You know if it's going to be something your tank can cruise across easily or something that will block the way. While I definitely appreciate the hexes from a battle strategy point of view, they are a royal pain with a joystick that moves in 4, not 6, directions. Also, if you're a fan of plots, you'll be disappointed. You get a RED ARMY!! going up against a BLUE ARMY!! and someone has to win. There is a map editor - but it's on the difficult side to use and you can only have a top-down view of what you are doing.  It would have been nice if they made this more full featured. Also, you are given 8 \"sides\" (i.e. countries) to play with, but it would have been great if you could create additional sides, i.e. name your own country and mix up your own batch of units to fight with. Still, if you can get over the various hurdles and just hunker down to treat this like a type of chess, focussing on the pure strategy in one-on-one combat, you'll find a lot to enjoy here. I just would have thought that a \"version 7\" of a game that they would have really polished up some of these aspects of the game.</td><td>Nice Strategy - but Could be Better</td><td>1159574400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>87874</td><td>4.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>09 30, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000G82QEO</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Samurai Warriors 2 is another chapter in the Dynasty Warriors / Samurai Warriors line. You get a warrior with a long weapon who bashes his way through thousands of enemies. If you've played any of the Warriors saga, you know exactly what you're in for. A series of battles, based loosely on historical events in Japanese hisory. Gigantically huge groueps of enemies that you plow through, building up chained attacks to create sweeping blows, much like Sauron did in the introductory scene to Lord of the Rings. You find chests, items and power-ups lying around the field to give you extra powers.  There are a few 'named characters' on the map to take down, but you're primarily sweeping through nameless minions. There is some character customization here. First, you choose from amongst about 25 different characters, some which you unlock as you play. Then you can customize these characters as you build up their experience, to match your gameplay style. However, this isn't a RPG at all. This is a quick and easy hack and slash game. There are some people who will find this boring - or completely unnecessary given that there were many other Warriors games before this one.  Do we really need another one with only slightly better graphics? I happen to be one of those people who really loves this type of game. Yes, I enjoy the more complex, long epic games that you play for months, solving puzzles and advancing plotlines. However, sometimes I am just exhausted from work and want to do something mindless and immediately satisfying. I love the Japanese culture and really enjoy running around in a feudal Japanese environment, with my chosen-type bodyguards staying with me at every moment, blowing away thousands of enemies in a sweep. It's instant accomplishment, and if I only have 15 minutes to play, I can rack up a ton of kills in that time. There's a new mini-game here, sort of like Samurai Monopoly, but I found it a little silly. I have enough other online boardgames that if that's what I want to do, I can do that with good graphics and gameplay. I'd rather that Samurai Warriors 2 put their spare time into other fun mini-games of the action variety, not into a board game. Still, I just don't play it. If other people enjoy that, have fun.  It's like the cut scenes. They get really silly at times, so I just ignore them. It's the gameplay itself that I enjoy. If you're looking for enemy destruction fun which is easy to learn and satisfying to play for short and long periods of time, then I definitely recommend Samurai Warriors 2. If you already have Samurai Warriors, if you play it a lot, then I'd suggest upgrading to this. It's more of the same fun, with a few extra features.</td><td>Another Classic in the Warriors Line</td><td>1159574400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>87157</td><td>4.0</td><td>16</td><td>false</td><td>09 30, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000G75AMK</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Naruto Clash of Ninja 2 features the same voice actors as in the cartoon show dub. You can immerse yourself in the Naruto world in this fighting game. The graphics are cel shaded and 3D, integrating well into the traditional Naruto style landscapes. The voices are the same as the cartoon series' dub - which you can either really appreciate, because you love the series in English - or which you can really be annoyed by, because the characters constantly mis-pronounce many simple Japanese names. Where many cartoon fighting games are extremely easy, this one actually has some challenge to it. There are multiple characters, and you can have up to 4 people on the screen at any given time. The combos for a given character can be relatively tricky. All of the characters are supposed to know the basic ninja techniques that they have learned in their training. However, for some reason, only certain characters can use certain basic moves, all depending on which happened to use that move in an episode. It would have been more realistic and interesting if everyone knew the basic moves but then differed on advanced moves. The arenas you fight in are interesting - there are temples, outdoor areas, and other environments. The backgrounds are slightly animated, with crowds of cheering people going through the same one-second-long loop continuously. However, they aren't as advanced as most other fighting games out right now. You can't interact with your environment, you can't move from area to area or watch weather or movement of the world you're in. A lot of this is because of the GameCube's inherent limitations, but it does stand out when you've been playing other fighting games on other systems. I found several of the comments made by certain characters to be incredibly repetitive. It was fine the first time, or the tenth time ... but after 100 times of hearing the exact same statement, it wears on you. It's also a little odd that the main menu shows Sakura (a female) looking at you, but all of the voice you hear is Naruto (a male). Still, for Naruto fans who have a GameCube at home, this is a great way to immerse yourself in the Naruto world and enjoy it for hours on end. There are numerous characters, lots of battles to play and replay, and a variety of ways to upgrade while you learn all of the combos. As a small bonus, you get a collectable card as part of the set. Well recommended for Naruto fans.</td><td>Great Fighting Game for Naruto Fans</td><td>1159574400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>48066</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>09 3, 2007</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00009XS6F</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I-Ninja is a cute little platformer that is clearly similar to games such as Ratchet & Clank and Gex. You're a little cartoony ninja, running around odd worlds with your sword and climbing chain. There are numerous levels here, and as you go you build up your movies, weapons arsenal, and more. The game is very easy to pick up and get going with. You hit traditional buttons to jump and double jump, attack, and move. You can run up walls, use your chain to swing across gapes, and so on. Anybody who has played any Zelda / Ratchet / other platformers will have the basics of this game down in about 2 seconds. That's not to say it's easy. Many of the levels can be quite challenging. You know WHAT you have to do - but you have to try over and over again to actually do it properly. This can on one hand be quite thrilling when you do make it to the end and savor your victory. On the other hand if you're a gamer who doesn't have hours and hours to devote to one level - and perhaps has a parent standing over your shoulder with a stopwatch ready to pull the plug on you - this can get really frustrating, really quickly. There are checkpoints in the middle of missions, which helps a lot with the above-said replaying. At least you don't have to do the entire thing all over again from scratch. The graphics are quite nice - they did a nice job with the textures and color combinations. Yes, a few things are still blocky, but this is a PS2. I really do feel they did a good job with the programming here. All except for ... the camera!! The camera in this game drives me completely insane! There are so many times that I want to look in a certain direction and have to do a number of operations before I can get the camera to go there. You would think after all this time that game companies would make an easy to use camera system. I just don't get why i-Ninja has such a problem with this. Still, you can live with it, and the game really is quite fun.

There is great voice acting - but less great gameplay. First off, you need to be prepared for how short this game is. I've played games where the cinematics alone took up multiple hours, and to be honest with this game being based on a multi-year fantastic award winning series, with awesome actors, I was expecting that here too. However, the dialogue is often very trite, and there isn't nearly enough of it. You are not one of the main characters from the show - instead you are an up and coming punk, a bastard child of Big Pussy. You are of course given silly little tasks at first, but as you prove your worth, they give you more and more challenging things to do. Often you're roaming around classic locations from the show. Here's the problem. You would think with such a wealth of material to work from, and such fantastically complex, intricate plots, that they could easily pull off a multi-hour game. Sadly, that is not the case. Instead, you get a pretty straightforward series of activities that could come from pretty much any clone game. The graphics are not stellar, either. The PS2 has been out for enough years that some rather impressive graphics have been created for it. There were numerous issues with The Sopranos that, really, a game with this kind of backing should not have displayed. I do adore the Sopranos and admit it was fun to romp around in the Sopranos world. So let's take it for granted that some sort of game in the Sopranos WOULD be made, and that it would involve the cast members. That is never really a question here. The question is whether that world is a quality done world. I'm afraid the answer is - not really. Certainly, if you adore the Sopranos, rent this game to see what it's all about. You'll probably get through it long before the rental period is up, and only have spent a few dollars. If you find that you adore talking to \"real voice characters\" over and over again enough to own it, you can always buy yourself a copy at that point.</td><td>Great Actors - Not Much Else</td><td>1188777600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>63418</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>09 3, 2007</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0007PLKZM</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Scarface is based on the classic movie starring Al Pacino. In this game, Tony Montana didn't die at the end of the movie. Instead, he has to rebuild his empire piece by piece - and he is VERY angry. The movie was classic for its over the top violence and fury. You need to be aware that this game is rated M for Mature - and it most definitely earns that rating. There is non stop swearing throughout the game, and a great deal of slaughter. If you thought the Grand Theft Auto games were bad, this takes it a step beyond. It's definitely intriguing to have a Cuban themed world around you, rather than the stereotypical Italian or ghetto worlds that many other games provide. There is a sense of style generated by a lot of the scenes here, and the dialogue and action is quite involving. They did a great job with the graphics, although I have to admit that the incredible detail of the Grand Theft Auto series has really spoiled me. If I see a location, I want to be able to go explore it. The Scarface designers only made certain parts of each map playable, and erected invisible force fields everywhere else to prevent you from going there. Those bug me to no end :) Surely they could have spent an extra few weeks in development to let me wander around that area, even if I didn't find anything. It would make the game seem more \"real\", and my choices more my own. Also, it would be nice to have things other to do than just mow down enemies. I like games that offer a variety of tasks, but this isn't one of them. If you get tired of the non-stop violence, you have to pop another game into the console in order to relax a bit before you go back to the game. Still, the game is great fun, and as long as you accept the mature rating and one-track gameplay.</td><td>Single Minded, Mature and Fun</td><td>1188777600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>56498</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>09 3, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00026RFI2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Dragon Ball Z - Budokai 3 follows in the footsteps of games 1 and 2. Part fighting game, part story mode RPG, you get to fully involve yourself in the Dragon Ball Z universe. There is a huge number of characters available here, both major and minor. There's a large world that you can fly around completely freely, as compared with the previous versions that stuck you on a set board. The graphics are cel shaded very distinctly \"cartoony\" main characters against a more gentle painted background / landscape. The animations are smooth and in keeping with the series style. The music is a bit tinny - I think they could have done better and still been true to the series - but since many fighting games have completely atrocious music, I can't criticize that too much. Of course we can say that Dragon Ball Z fans will love this game, and play it for years and years without stopping. It's impressive that this game even holds up very well for people who have never seen Dragon Ball Z. You learn about the game world as you go, and have great fun fighting. Once you unlock all the characters and battlefields, there's still more customization to do and skills to perfect. It really is a game that you can replay for months.

It's rather like Tetris with a dash of Lumines thrown in. For those who somehow missed out on Tetris and Lumines, both are falling-block style puzzle games. Tetris is famous for being the first, and Lumines has recently garnered praise for its gorgeous soundtracks and style themes. Meteos doesn't have quite the graphic flair of Lumines, but it does come close. In essence the \"story\" involves you launching attacks in space. The blocks fall down from the top of the screen, as usual in these games. Instead of trying to rotate the blocks though, they fall singly and you can then only drag a block up or down in its column to form rows or columns of matching colors. You can do this with the buttons but it is FAR faster and easier to use the stylus to do the dragging. The Lumines-style themes for background and block type start out with only a few options, but as you work your way through the game you unlock more and more. Some are simple, with classic single-colored blocks that look vaguely gem-like. Others are really wild, with little squiggly characters in each block. I find it really makes a big difference in how quickly I can get through a level, depending on which block set I use. Some are easy to see color combinations with, while others can make it quite a challenge. Once you get three of a color to line up, they don't vanish as in other Tetris style games. Instead, they \"blast upwards\", pushing up any blocks that happen to be higher in the stack. That is, if you have three full stacks of blocks and cause the bottommost three blocks to all be green, those three full stacks will start moving up off the screen. Sometimes they go right off - but sometimes they are sluggish and start to fall back downwards. You must then match up other threesomes in that stack to give the rockets extra \"energy\" to continue leaving the playing area. Once you get enough rocket blasts launched, you move on to the next stage. For Tetris addicts, it takes some practice to get the hang of only sliding blocks up and down, never left or right. Your mind keeps seeing patterns that you simply can't make. However, once you get your brain re-trained to think in up and down movements only, it really is quite fun. Part of a frustration factor for some people is going to be the controls. Pointing to the exact block you need with your stylus - and dragging it up or down to the exact right position - isn't always easy. Trying to use the controls instead is simply too slow. The game really rewards the dexterous, but will be quite annoying for those who don't have fine motor control. That being said, I really did have a lot of fun with Meteos, and am glad I got it!

The characters wear hip clothes and have a different aim in life - to have fun! As with the standard Sims game, you get to customize your character, although on the DS your choices are limited. A few hair styles, four shirts, and you're stuck with a miniskirt and boots although the colors can be cycled. You get questions such as: What is the meaning of life? * Having the toughest rep * Mad l33t computer skillz * Fat sacks of cash money * Bustin sweet rhymes I'm sorry, but none of these come close for me :) Other questions provide choices that are equally 'cute' but not necessarily even in the running. In one, you win $10k and your choices to spend it are on a pool, on perfume or on \"fancy bling\". Ick. The game itself uses the top screen for the actual monitor, and the bottom for your choices - watching current tasks, tracking inventory and so on. Sometimes it works well, when you keep your to-do list easily visible. Other times it is more kludgy, as you have to look back and forth between the two screens to make choices and see the results. The pacing of the game wasn't set up very well. I'm a long time Sims fan and understand all the basics of feeding, washing and entertaining your sim. But you begin in an apartment building with multiple floors and you spend your time racing from floor to floor to get to that toilet or bed before disaster strikes. Where other games let you explore and get comfortable with the game, for some reason the Urbz makes you feel like disaster is about to strike if you don't figure out where the nearest toilet is. There are the usual friendship building, which in this case involves first guessing and then remembering what topics a person enjoys talking about. That is a fun twist on the usual random chatter. There are also mini-games such as the \"avoid bird poop\" that gets the game going. Fun for those seeking a mission-based game that has a bit of urban hip appeal, but where the Sims is relaxing and rewarding, for some reason with the Urbz on DS it makes it feel like you're barely hanging on by the skin of your teeth. Which is maybe the edgy attitude they wanted, but I play games to escape from the stress of real life :)</td><td>Mini game - avoid bird poop?</td><td>1285718400</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>45457</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 29, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000095ZHA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Simpsons: Hit-and-Run is a game based on the television show, The Simpsons. It is very similar, gameplay-wise, to Grand Theft Auto III, except less controversial. You can be Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge, or Apu in this crazed spree around Springfield. The story is pretty basic at first: there are weird wasp/camera robots and black surveillance vans all around Springfield. The first level (levels being simply areas in Springfield, sometimes at different times) gives you the role of Homer, running around and doing missions (most of which are simple errands). You can run things and people (who don't die) over in your car, but too much results in getting fined by the police. The characters have neat quotes, like Homer when he runs someone over singing, \"I am Evil Homer! I am Evil Homer!\" You can also pick up rides from special characters like Comic Book Guy and Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel by doing special missions for them. The game is epic in length, and really draws you into their world with quests, mini-games, hunting tasks, and much more. You can easily play it for weeks without getting bored - and after we played it through, we promptly began again!

Using the basic gameplay and graphics of Halo 3, ODST is neat and different in some ways and disappointingly samey in others. ODST follows a squad of drop troopers - primarily through the eyes of Rookie, a silent protagonist. Rookie proceeds through the abandoned, dead city of New Mombasa looking for records of his teammates, who he was separated from. Finding these records allows you to play a segment as another trooper - Buck, the leader, Mickey, the tech specialist, Dutch, the tough guy, or Romeo, the sniper. Rookie's segments are really freeform and open - you explore the city, going through apartments and back alleys and occasionally running into random patrols of Covenant soldiers. The city's AI, the Supervisor, will occasionally try to get your attention by hijacking various city systems - signs will change to point you in the right direction, phones will start ringing, ticket machines will start spewing tickets, crosswalks and traffic lights will change, and so on. These directions will lead you to audio diaries - clues to a side-story - or weapon/ammo caches. All in all, it makes for a really great feel - almost to the level of Silent Hill - and it's backed up by some of the best music in the series. The action stages are pretty good, too, but far more traditional. There is some openness in the levels, but for the most part they're similar to normal Halo 3. This is where the main promise of ODST - the fact that you're playing as a normal soldier - kind of falls flat. You can basically do everything that the Master Chief can do, including but not limited to flipping over cars and punching through tanks. Your health works slightly differently, but it still basically equates to \"if you get hit, go duck behind cover until you recover\". You can get away with running up to Brutes and punching them in the face until they die. All in all, you basically demonstrate the same level of \"super-soldier\" that the actual super soldiers have, as opposed to having to rely on your wits and your guns to overcome your weakness. In addition to the campaign mode, ODST also offers a four-person co-op mode called \"Firefight\". In this mode, the human players attempt to hold out as long as they can against waves of Covenant troops. Like Gears of War 2's Horde mode, this can be a blast with the right people. To add a bit of difficulty into the mix, each wave of Covenant has a special effect attached to them - the ability to dodge grenades, or being more resistant to plasma, and so on. This ensures that the endless waves of Covenant continue to be challenging for as long as you play. The graphics are similar to Halo 3's, but the urban environment is much more well-designed than those in Halo 3. A lot of care went into designing the city and the various signs and objects scattered around it, and the end result feels pretty natural. The sound is really good, too. The most obvious change, sound-wise, is that an injured ODST will pant and groan realistically instead of offering a single grunt like the Master Chief does. This makes it feel a lot more immersive, and is almost worth the fact that - for game reasons - you can heal up really easily and dying's not really that big of a deal. On the whole, I understand why ODST didn't take a more realistic approach, but that doesn't mean it's not disappointing. As a game, ODST is good, but with some eye-rolling flaws that could've been turned into something more meaningful than \"another Halo game\". 8/10.</td><td>Good with some Eye Rolling Flaws</td><td>1254096000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>46161</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 26, 2009</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00009KO3S</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Viewtiful Joe is a fun game which has you play a person trapped in a movie, side scrolling along forward and backwards through time. Slow down and speed up to achieve your objectives! This game definitely has some fun. The graphics aren't cutting edge or stellar. Instead, they deliberately put \"hairs\" and scratches into the screen view to have you feel like you're watching an old time movie. You get the traditional jumping up to platforms, jumping down to ledges, collecting items, breaking items, killing enemies. Many games feel like that's enough - move along the path, kill enemies, jump up and down. But Viewtiful Joe takes it to a new level. Because you're \"in a movie\", you can control how the movie plays out. If an enemy is racing at you too quickly, you simply slow down time so you can deal with the enemies in a timely fashion. If speed is what you need, put yourself into turbo mode to zip along! It's important to keep in mind that at heart this is a side scroller. If you're a fan of high-quality graphics or Halo-like adventure, this probably isn't the game for you. But if you enjoy side scrollers, cel shading and puzzle styles of games with platformer jumping built in, this will be a lot of fun for you. The game is very family friendly. The hero isn't swearing or ripping limbs off of people. He's simply jumping up, jumping down, gathering items and squishing cartoon enemies. The game is very replayable. If you beat the easier level, there are more challenging levels waiting for you. to really test your abilities.

You have real time card strategy action mixed in with an epic storyline. It's fair enough to say that some people will love this game and other people will not feel the pull of the gameplay style. This is a *strategy* game. If you are a shooter fan, wanting to jump immediately into shooting and killing enemies, you will probably be disappointed. You can spend literally 15 minutes walking around talking and gathering before you're even allowed to enter into your first combat. This is a game that requires patience and dedication. For people with that time, attention and desire for strategy, they'll get everything they could ask for. Your characters move in real time as you play and attack, their swords flying, their wings moving. Your organize your cards and play them for the maximum effect. In the world around you, world-shaping events are taking place, and you meet a number of characters, roam through landscapes, and explore this world. It compares with Final Fantasy and other similar games, but with a card base. The sound is reasonably good, with epic, energizing music pulling you into the gameplay. I found some of the voice actors to be uninspiring, but you find that in most games of this type. You're not expecting drama quality acting. I would recommend people play the first Baten Kaitos before moving on to this one. That way you get a feel for the series and style, and really get a full appreciation for this game. This is definitely a game that will keep you occupied for WEEKS. Other games out there can be finished in a day. This isn't one of them. Between the side-quests and other things to do, you'll be busy for a long while. Again, depending on your personality, this can be great, or this can be too much.

Jump, duck, kick and punch your way through enemies. Soon you'll learn about your special abilities - to slow down time or speed it up. This helps you to solve puzzles, slay enemies and have lots of fun. In the previous game you got to play just Joe, but now you get to switch off with Sylvia whenever you want to.  I'm always fond of games that let you play male or female characters. The graphics here are deliberately cel shaded and low key. There are clipping errors with capes sliding through platforms and fuzzy old-style-movie lines and scratches at times. This is part of the character of the game. If you're going to be upset by this and wish you were playing Halo 3, then I'd suggest you play the other games in your style. This game focuses on the fun and platforming, rather than on crystal-sharp graphics. Also, of course, being made for the GameCube, they simply didn't have high quality graphics available back then. You earn new powers as you go on, traverse a variety of landscapes, and generally wreak mayhem on the enemies around you. The game is very family friendly, as long as you don't mind bashing cartoon enemies into puffs of smoke :) The music is generally innocuous, typical jazzy music that bops around in the background. It doesn't stand out as being stellar, but it doesn't grate on your ears either. Well recommended for fans of side scrolling action - the addition of slow and fast give a range of action which most side scrollers don't contain.

You have groups of ships, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of normal combat where you only have to worry about driving along roads or crossing mountains, in Homeworld 2 there are the full 3 dimensions to work in space. You can sneak around behind someone ... or you can sneak around UNDERNEATH someone. The graphics are simply amazing, with the tiny details of the ships and the vastness of scale when you put a tiny scout up against a huge mother ship. You really feel like your actions are affecting a real situation, and the plotline is very engaging. It's hard to stop playing at 2am even when you're sleepy. The multiplayer game also ensures that even when you finish the campaign, you've only just begun to play. You can easily spend months and months challenging players around the globe to a number of scenarios. In essence, the gameplay can go on forever - or at least until they come out with Homeworld 3 someday!! Highly, highly recommended.</td><td>Amazing space combat and multiplayer</td><td>1064448000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>49408</td><td>4.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>09 25, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0000A2MCN</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>NOTE: Amazon seems to have combined reviews for many separate games in one area. This review is for Jedi Academy. In yet another chapter of the ongoing Star Wars gaming empire, you are a young trainee in the Jedi School of Lightsabers and Force Powers. It seems that every new scene in this game has you running into one of the Classic Heroes of the storyline - Luke Skywalker, Kyle Katarn, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, etc. And each of the characters quotes their traditional lines - \"I've got a bad feeling about this\" ... \"I sense a disturbance in the force\" ... etc. I'm a big, big fan of the Star Wars saga but I have to admit that it would have been nicer if they left those cameos as special treats, instead of making you feel like, even though you're a brand new trainee, you were plunked right into the middle of the most important characters in the rebel alliance! The graphics are really great, with a lot of detail on faces and weapons. While it was nice that you could customize your main character, they only had 3 presets for male and another 3 for female - and they didn't match up. So while you could be a male Rhodian, you couldn't be a *female* Rhodian which is what I really wanted to be. There were only 3 faces to choose from and a few shirts. Most role playing games out there nowadays give you much more flexibility so this was disappointing. You start out with simple training sessions to learn about lightsaber use, force pushes and pulls, and so on. Your master is Kyle, and soon you and Kyle are heading off planet to do various tasks for the Jedi. While the game gives you a good mix of combat and puzzle, I have to admit I felt very much like Super Mario at times, working to jump-jump-jump up a series of blocks ... falling down if the jump wasn't timed just right and starting over again. The combat gets better in later levels but at the beginning it's easy for it to turn into a button mashing contest. Definitely a good game for any Star Wars fan to get, but I recommend the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies for anyone looking for a real RPG experience. The character creation, development and combat feels much more rewarding in Galaxies. But those looking for a quick fix will find it here!</td><td>Good action game, not a great RPG</td><td>1064448000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>31298</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>09 25, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00005V3TH</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Looking for something new and fun to do with your Sim Family?

Just like in real vacations, this is time to kick back, relax and enjoy quality family time. The vacation is a vacation for you, the player too. You're not quite a busy taking care of every little need, you're not worrying about friends or timetables. You're having fun! There are neat games to play, fun characters to interact with, new scenery to look at! Perhaps your only concern is ... running out of money. Just like real life! You can camp. You can ski. You can even fish! You can find fun things to bring back home with you, to remind you of your time on vacation. On the downside, if you have a guest, that guest is completely brainless. You can't help them take care of their needs, and they rarely do it well on their own. So your guest will be miserable.

But then when I upgraded to Windows XP, it didn't work quite right, I managed to lose my Living Large CD and gave up on it for a while. Then I saw this new release become available. It contains both the original Sims PLUS Living Large's neat jobs and home accessories. Plus it has Sims Creator in it, so you can custom design your very own sims!! Add to that a whole plethora of new items, clothing, and it works PERFECTLY on XP. I loaded it up right when I got home. My old Sim family worked like a charm, no problems at all! In no time at all I was busy customizing their home, buying them new furniture, running very smoothly. It hasn't crashed at all since this new install, and I've been playing it quite a bit! This is great gameplay for all ages. It's very constructive - it makes you really think about your real life world. You look at the mess in your room and realize it affects your happiness, even if in some slight way that you might not normally notice. You start to get hungry and realize your energy is fading and that you're getting a bit more grumpy, something you might not have noticed otherwise! I know many Sim-fans that find their real life world improves as they become more aware of these sorts of things.

There are all sorts of new interaction choices! Your range of kisses has grown immensely, you can flirt in new and fun ways with people. Keeping your group of friends is now much more fun. There are a bunch of new items for your sims to use and enjoy in their homes. You can take a picnic basket to your back yard or hang out in the Love Tub. You can buy candy or chocolates, carry it in your inventory and give them to your true love! If you're tired of staying at home, now there's an entirely new downtown area! Just call a cab, you can even invite a friend to come along with you. Head down to the beach and enjoy the sand. Go shopping for a teddy bear in the mall. Play pinball or stop by the ice cream stand. It's great to watch your Sims have some fun out of that same house you stare at every day! I find that I mostly enjoy the added features in the home life - the way my interactions at home are so enriched. I like going downtown occasionally, but the core of my playing is still at home. It really does add to the game though, and you'll find that you start thinking in sim-thought with your own real live family!

It has great potential, but also can be very frustrating. (...) So finally I had Spore installed. Now to start playing! In cell mode I wanted to be an herbivore. Big mistake. While there are lots of enemies around to eat if you're a carnivore, and an omnivore can eat anything, a poor herbivore can only eat plants. Once those plants are gone, you're pretty much doomed. Everything wants to eat you. I found out quickly through trial and error that an omnivore was your best bet. A few \"upgrades\" later, and I was moving on to creature mode. In creature mode you take your same basic cell shape and move up onto land. Again, it became apparent through several replayings that plant eaters had a rough life. You want to be an omnivore so you can eat your enemies when you find them - and also fall back on plants if you're surrounded by things too tough to attack. On you go through the higher levels, and the game morphs along to let you build tribes, gather food, get space flight. At each level you switch to a new set of skills and have to learn new gameplay. I really love the idea - but I wish the game carried more over from level to level. When you go from cell to creature level, you are left with a bunch of \"useless body parts\". You need to in essence completely redesign your creature for the new challenges. Also I wish the game did not seem to heavily biased towards omnivore. Maybe they are trying to teach us a lesson here :) It is only through an equal balance of aggression and pacifism that you can survive. I definitely find this game to be a time sink, and can lose myself in it for hours. However, compared with other games I play, the time does not pass in a \"stress release\" fashion. For example if I play Halo or Age of Empires or StarCraft or other games I get caught up in them, have a lot of fun and feel quite happy when I'm over. Most of the time when I'm playing Spore I'm feeling frustrated with the enemies, stressed about finding more food, and annoyed that my people are off migrating or being attacked by wild animals and needing help. It's a \"demanding\" game. I love challenges and tough opponents - but it shouldn't be stress inducing. I'll give the game a 3/5. It is certainly fun in a way, and I give it a ton of credit for being innovative. However, the evolutions could have been handled far better, the balance on each particular level could have been much more even, and that copy protection scheme is just awful. I only have Spore installed on my laptop and this is the first time I've ever had to do that - do a single-system install because I am afraid of running out of reinstall options once I switch machines. I shouldn't be in that situation with a game I paid for.</td><td>Multiple Installs and Gameplay Issues</td><td>1222214400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>226223</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 23, 2014</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B004FS8LYK</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Tomb Raider for the PS3 is an origin story for Lara Croft. It explores how this young woman grows, builds her strength, and becomes the woman we know. Let me first say that I've always had a love-hate relationship with the Tomb Raider series. Absolutely I was thrilled when it first came out, for so many reasons. It had a strong, capable female lead. It was fun to play. In a world where women had been forced to play male leads for years and years, there was finally a female lead that guys were willing to play. The down side, of course, was the reason many of them played. I heard from guy after guy after guy that they loved jamming Lara into a corner so they could stare at her breasts. She was more a strip club object to them than a capable female. It got incredibly depressing. Fast forward to current times. Now it's far more \"normal\" for men to play games with woman leads and not feel it harms their manhood. They accept as a fact that women can be in combat roles or adventure roles and hold their own. All of that is an amazing transition in not too many years. And I think this latest release of Tomb Raider helps to reflect that. This new Lara Croft has normal proportions! She's a real, living woman. She's capable and strong - and also has normal fears and concerns. She's tough and compassionate. She's loyal and caring. She's what one would hope a woman should be - and both men and women appreciate her. Both admit to playing the game without qualms about this being \"wrong\" somehow. It's just impressive that we've changed our gaming psyche so much in such a short period of time. The game is great. The graphics, the emotion, the puzzles, the progression of skill - all draw you in and help you stay involved in what is going on. There's solid writing. Solid level design. So much to be happy with here. And still, the thing that makes me the most content is hearing all the reviews from men and women where they focus on the gameplay itself - without having to stare at her breasts as if this is the only reason one could want to play a game with a female lead. It makes me proud to be a gamer.

However, this is not a worthy sequel (or prequel). First, a lot of the hype about the game is that they have great actors voicing the parts now. Elijah Wood (Frodo) is Spyro. David Spade is Sparx the dragonfly. It just doesn't work well. The Sparx character really annoyed me at several sections of the game. They moved away from cute and fun to \"turn the sound off\". Speaking of which, the background sound balance is off so that half the time you can't heard what's being said. On one hand the graphics are pretty - on the other hand the camera drives me completely insane. Nice eye-candy jewels do not make up for frustrating gameplay. The gameplay feels more violent. The creatures scream in agony as you repeatedly flame them. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be darker or more brutal.  Either way it detracts from the fun to me. Pretty much all of your game is beating up on things.  You're missing the fun mini-games and quests that other Spyro games offer. Also, the game is SHORT. At least if there was long playability here you could excuse a few other problems, but for what you've paid for the game you barely get into a weekend with it. I'm not quite sure what happened here. It's not like the game makers had any question about what really works in the Spyro game. The previous Spyro games were HUGE sellers and had a very loyal fan base. Why deliberately harm a franchise that was doing so well? Why deliberately shorten it so drastically? It really seems like they wanted some quick, easy cash and hoped that nobody would notice how poor the game was. Or if they did notice, that it would be too late because they already played the game. I highly suggest you rent this game for a weekend - you'll undoubtedly finish the game over that weekend. If you really find you adore the game, then great! Buy a copy and enjoy. I really think though that you'll find a weekend is more than enough time with this.

You've got an Ausssie-style Tiger on platforming style wild adventures. I really enjoyed the first Ty game so I had high hopes coming into this one. The game certainly kicks off instantly. There's no training, no prologue - you're just dumped into an emergency situation and are off and running. You're bashing, jumping, racing, trying to take out the bad guys. Unfortunately, the balance is not well done. I heard from several people that they got stuck on this entry level! The mech battle involves you shooting down robots and flying ships. If you just focus on the robots (at their heads) you do fine - but if you try to take out both sets of enemies you're pretty much doomed to replaying over and over again. This is part of the flaw I find with this new game. It has the cute music - but the balance with the voices is so bad at times that I found myself relying on the subtitles to know what was being said. At other times the music is really annoying and makes me want to turn it off. Sometimes the enemies are fun to bash away at. At other times there are just too many and it feels frustrating. The game is aimed at kids which is why these things bother me. This is supposed to be meant for youngsters who perhaps are playing their first platformer game and need friendly help in getting started. The characters are friendly enough - your \"team\" offers you warm encouragement - but the gameplay itself can easily prove quite frustrating (as proven by the email messages I get about this). Cute graphics and an engaging Aussie accent just can't make up for gameplay problems like this. I do agree it's fun to play with different boomerangs, to drive around in a mech and to experience the wonders of an Australian world. I give them a lot of credit. I'll give them a 4/5 for that. I just think more play-testing time would have ironed out some of these issues.</td><td>Not as Fun as the first</td><td>1253664000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>80353</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 23, 2007</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000F3Z59S</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Dreamfall - The Longest Journey is the sequel to the original adventure game named The Longest Journey. This game is more like participating in a 10 hour movie than playing a game, and your primary goal is to watch cut-scenes, solve a puzzle or two, and run on gathering quests. I'm not saying at all that this is not FUN. The graphics are really immersive and push the XBox to its limits. Each world is fully developed and integrated, with the textures, atmosphere, sounds and visions all merging in together nicely. The sound is equally well done. The dialogue and voices are simply stellar, Sure, there are one or two exceptions, but in general this game provides a standard that others games could be held against. You really believe these are individual people who have a history and personality. Like any good novel, there are a TON of characters, each with their own wants, desires, aims and goals. Refreshingly in the gaming world, most of the main characters are female. You start with Zoe, a smart college drop-out who is trying to find a new goal in her life. Her best friend is a savvy computer wiz - a female - who is able to help with all sorts of issues. Another character you play is also female, the leader of her group. It's really great to see so many powerful female characters in one game. The down side is, for being a \"game\", there is not a lot of \"playing\" here. There are a few puzzles worked in. There are an awful lot of \"find item X and bring it to place Y\" missions. There is combat - but the combat system drove me completely insane. You could block, hit hard or hit soft - and the controls were sluggish and difficult to work with. I think I've played most combat games that are out there, and this rates down near the bottom. Sure, combat isn't a main part of the game, but if you die repeatedly due to a really silly interface, it makes the game not fun. Another part of the game that gets tedious really quickly is the fact that you somehow don't know where anything is, even in places you apparently live in. You have to search all over to find your best friend's apartment?  I can understand when you get into new towns that you have to track down the bar or whatever, but hunting in your own hometown for places you really should know how to find is nonsensical. The maps in general are very unwieldy. I know they mean to add to the adventure to cause you to search for a half hour to find place X, but it doesn't make the game more fun to do that. It seems like a way for them to claim the game took more than 10 hours to solve, because half the time you're roaming aimlessly on a map looking for something. The other half of the time you're trying to click on the exact right spot to open a door or to perform an action. Aim slightly off, and you could find yourself climbing down a ladder you didn't mean to get on, or heading off into another loading screen. Again, it's not to say the game is bad. For people who love \"playing a novel\", and who have a lot of time and patience, this is a really great game. But for gamers who are only alloted 2 hours after homework is done to play something enjoyable - and who then waste 2 hours roaming around a rainy map trying to track down one specific doorway - it can lose its shine very quickly. Finally, while the game boasts super-long cut scenes and interactive dialogue (where you can be, say, pushy or docile in response to a question), it became a bit excessive. Many choices seemed unreasonable, and in many cases when I chose one option, it ended up doing things I didn't want it to do at all. For example in one situation I tried to be uncooperative and not divulge private information - and the next thing I know, Zoe is blabbing every last detail. It makes for a bit of frustration. There's going to be a sequel to this, so we'll see if they find the right balance between longer gameplay that involves actual gameplay, instead of adding in even more super-long cut scenes and maps you have to wend your way around for hours on end.</td><td>A novel posing as a game - it depends on your gaming style</td><td>1190505600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>58560</td><td>5.0</td><td>51</td><td>false</td><td>09 23, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0002HTAYS</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Sims dynasty continues with the release of Sims 2, the first real overhaul of the popular series in a long time. There are so many improvements, it's hard to know where to begin! First, the graphics have been enhanced greatly. You begin by making your family, including all ages. You can tweak every aspect of your sim's appearance, from hairstyles to tattoos to a huge range of clothing. You can have your sims in love with each other, married, have kids and more. The Sim world is no longer four-angled - you can do full rotation around in circles. The graphics are extremely impressive. The starting selection of items and decorations is extensive, but you know that in short order there will be millions of add-ons coming down the road :) So this is only the beginning. I am THRILLED to find that they finally give you days off from work, and even let you earn vacation days, so that you can rest and relax in between your hard working day hours. The entire pace is much more balanced than the original game - you feel like you have plenty of time to enjoy your house and throw parties, as well as putting in the required hours at work. Your computer in the game is far more useful now, letting you chat with friends, send email, order groceries, and even play SSX. For hard core sims fans, the real glory comes in the fact that your characters actually go through a life cycle. They age (very slowly) and as they have kids, you watch the kids grow up and age, too. The kids even have the traits of the parents! So you can literally go through generations of sims, raising each one up. In addition, each sim has one of five \"lifestyle goals\". Maybe your sim is after knowledge - or maybe they want the happy family life. Your sim could covet money or romantic encounters. Whatever it is that makes your sim happy, by hitting goals in that area the sim earns bonus points. So those sims who aren't happy with the 'career track' can still achieve kudos by working towards other aims. Highly highly recommended for any Sims fan. It's just as good as the original Sims in playability - and far improved in many ways! BTW: Check your PC against the game requirements before buying. Newer PCs should have no problem - in fact I'm playing it on my laptop - but ancient PCs might be unhappy.</td><td>Amazing Game - Well Worth the Wait</td><td>1095897600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>189804</td><td>3.0</td><td>32</td><td>false</td><td>09 22, 2009</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0025QJU1C</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The sequel to Cyberlore's original \"Majesty\", released in 2000, \"Majesty 2\" is a Fantasy Kingdom Simulator by a completely different studio that attempts to uphold the standard established by its predecessor. In some ways, it succeeded; in other ways, it could not. Majesty 2 places you in the role of a king ruling over a fantasy realm. As with Majesty 1, you control the realm indirectly; you can hire heroes and cast some spells, but most of the work of the realm is carried out automatically. Once you've hired heroes, you can influence them with reward flags; placing bounties on monsters, or marking certain areas for exploration. Majesty 2 also adds two new flags - a timed \"protect\" flag that heroes will guard until it expires, and a \"fear\" flag that warns them to stay away from an area. The economic system is taken from Majesty as well. Tax collectors are sent out from your castle to the various guilds and markets of your realm. Places for heroes to buy weapons and items are the most prosperous; heroes will go out, slay enemies, and then return laden with gold to spend it on upgrades, and thus bring it into your kingdom's circulation. Heroes on the whole are similar, too, with a few differences. Warriors are your basic tanks, armed with sword and shield. Rangers carry bows and are the main explorers. Clerics heal allies (though you get them much earlier than you did in Majesty, which is a little unbalancing). Rogues are easily influenced by money, though their design is different than Majesty - they use knives instead of crossbows, which means that they're not particularly helpful in a fight due to their low health. Wizards are powerful spell-slingers, but are weak at low levels. One difference with heroes is that they can be upgraded to a different temple-based class. This is roughly equivalent to hiring paladins, barbarians and the like in Majesty; all it really means is that in addition to hiring these warriors directly from the temple, you can choose to upgrade a lower class into a higher one - keeping experience, but leaving items behind. Another difference is that you can organize heroes into parties in Inns. Parties will hang out together, thus ensuring their group safety. Finally, at the end of every scenario, you can choose one hero to designate as a \"lord\". Lords can be brought from mission to mission, keeping their experience, gold, and items. This adds some element of connection to the game, and you can get attached to your more powerful characters if you use them enough. The main problem with the game, though, is that the campaign is relatively short and there is no real Free Build mode. Majesty had a mode where you could set various options and just play on a random map; Majesty 2 lacks that feature, but has a few pre-made scenarios. However, since the free building was the main source of replay value in the game, this difference is a major problem with the game. There were so many different options in the original that the outright removal of the feature just seems silly. The graphics are unpleasantly outdated. Stylistically, it looks somewhere between Warcraft III and World of Warcraft; lots of cartoony armor and stylized buildings. However, the actual effects and textures aren't that great, and it's not a particularly fun game to watch. Two years ago it might have been acceptable, but now it just looks outdated. It doesn't look distractingly bad, but it doesn't look good, either. You can't really arrange your town - buildings can't be rotated - so there's no joy in making a prosperous city since it's all a giant mess of structures. Most of the voice acting is pretty bad, with the exception of the Advisor, who is actually the same voice actor from the original Majesty. Many of the lines of the heroes in the game are the same as the original game's, but because of the bad voice acting it just seems like a shallow attempt to appeal to the original's fans. The music is nice, but forgettable. As a whole, Majesty 2 is kind of fun, but not good in its own right. The low production quality and the lack of random maps really upsets it. There's multiplayer, but it uses the archaic Gamespy Arcade for internet play. Honestly, it feels like it should have been released four years ago; as it is now, it's really just disappointing. 6/10.</td><td>Disappointing Sequel to Great Game</td><td>1253577600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>144139</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>09 21, 2012</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000WSE2WM</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>With so many serious combat games out there, sometimes it's fun to kick back and have a little fun.

And you're not out to save the world from impending annihilation. Instead, you're just trying to do what you can to get through the battle with a bit of loot to make your retirement a nice one. It's funny how the game turns many classic war cliches upside-down. This is definitely irreverent. And still, you have a lot of fun with it, getting to know the characters and their personalities. I can laugh out loud at the dialogue even multiple times through. The gameplay is fun. There are extensive maps full of items to collect and gather up, and of course enemies to slaughter. You can destroy pretty much anything you want to, and enemies don't constantly regenerate out of some mysterious human-generator just behind the corner. It gives you a sense that this universe you're plowing through is reasonable. There is a multiplayer mode but we don't tend to be multplayer people. I've heard from others that they love the multiplayer mode. I can report that the single player action is enormously fun and even on replays it still brings a smile. Are there any down sides here? The game's about shooting and exploding people. It's not meant for little kids. If you're not a fan of combat, this probably isn't the game for you. But we absolutely adore this game.

And you're not out to save the world from impending annihilation. Instead, you're just trying to do what you can to get through the battle with a bit of loot to make your retirement a nice one. It's funny how the game turns many classic war cliches upside-down. This is definitely irreverent. And still, you have a lot of fun with it, getting to know the characters and their personalities. I can laugh out loud at the dialogue even multiple times through. The gameplay is fun. There are extensive maps full of items to collect and gather up, and of course enemies to slaughter. You can destroy pretty much anything you want to, and enemies don't constantly regenerate out of some mysterious human-generator just behind the corner. It gives you a sense that this universe you're plowing through is reasonable. There is a multiplayer mode but we don't tend to be multplayer people. I've heard from others that they love the multiplayer mode. I can report that the single player action is enormously fun and even on replays it still brings a smile. Are there any down sides here? The game's about shooting and exploding people. It's not meant for little kids. If you're not a fan of combat, this probably isn't the game for you. But we absolutely adore this game. I love the humor, the gameplay, and the landscapes. Highly recommended.

Unfortunately for Vader, you aren't quite as perfect as he had hoped. You still have feelings and memories which interfere with his direct commands. You are still in love with Juno - and Vader is furious with you for your failings. The graphics are lovely. You're a dual-wielding saber dude who can bash everything within sight. You gain points as you destroy objects, and unlock challenges. You fight stormtroopers and robots of all shapes and sizes. The stirring Star Wars music is everywhere. The game is quite forgiving. When you die you usually start very close to where you left off. So you are encouraged to just plow ahead and tackle enemies. And the game supports that. You're starting out as a well trained soldier, not as a newbie. So right from the beginning you take on enemies with power and skill. There are tweaks that you can do to your lightsaber, like adding gems to give them color changes and bonusses. But on the other hand you're stuck with your one character. He is the way he is. He can't have dark skin, or be female, or anything else. In our modern world that's quite bizarre. Why can't you use a character that connects with you? These are all minor issues compared with the one massive failing of this game, though. It is incredibly short. You could pick it up on a Friday after work, expect to sit down to a long weekend of game playing fun. And then you're barely through your third slice of pizza and THE GAME ENDS. Sure you might expect four hour gameplay if it was a cheap download that you got to pass the time until you headed out to a movie. But for a full price game? A game with this history? It makes absolutely no sense at all. Sure you can replay it on a harder level. Sure you can do some of the challenges. But when you get a game like this you expect a fairly long, epic-style story with character development, plot twists, and intrigue. Finally, we have had the game crash on us at the hardest level.

Let's just take new games as they come and see how they play as their own view of the world. In that sense Watch Dogs, like most of the open world games, has its good and not-so-good aspects. It's got an involving storyline that's well presented. You're sucked in quickly and care about the hero and what he's going through. You want to help him move through the events and learn what's going on. Some games are just about shoot-shoot-shoot without emotional involvement. Here you have the shooting and challenges, but there's a reason behind it, too. You're driven to get it right. I'm generally not a fan of one-save games. There are so many different reasons to have multiple save options. It's frustrating that a game wouldn't allow that. The graphics are reasonably good, and the world has an impressive amount of detail. Sure, there are games that are better and games that are worse. In this one, you can immerse yourself, which means it's fine enough for the job. There's a wealth of things to do and, sure, some are repetitive. Others are great fun. A lot of times this comes down to a personal's individual personality and what they like. Some people love poker. Some don't. That's all right. I enjoyed this. It does well at what it claims it'll do - and I appreciate the effort put into the storyline.</td><td>Good Investment of Gaming Time</td><td>1411171200</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>164660</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 20, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0018L2VVQ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>If you have a Wii Fit game with the balance board, it's good to keep the balance board in something safe while you carry it around or store it. This sleeve does a reasonable job. In essence this is a neoprene sleeve that is just fitted to the size of the balance board, with carrying handles on the top end. You have to jam the board a little bit to get it to fit into the sleeve, but once it's in there, it's secure. The sleeve isn't incredibly thick - you don't want to be dropping your board down a flight of concrete stairs. Still, it does provide some safety against dings or gentle hits while you are carrying the unit around. And since the actual board doesn't have handles on it, just the fact that you have a pair of handles here is a nice feature. The sleeve is reversible so you have two color options. I'm not really that picky about what color my balance board's carried in, but if you care, you have the choice! Are there down sides? Well, as mentioned the sleeve is fairly tight. It can be a bit of an effort to shove the board into the sleeve. That then means that I don't tend to keep the board in the sleeve when it's sitting around, because I'd rather be able to just grab the board to use it vs to tug it out of the sleeve. Also, because of the nature of neoprene, when you pick up the handles, they \"sag\". There isn't any sort of a sturdy frame to the sleeve, so the whole sleeve pulls and stretches from the handles. I think they could have done better by making a plastic frame of some sort so that the handles were more sturdy at holding the unit in place. Still relatively minor complaints for an item that does its job quite nicely. If you've got a balance board and tend to move it from place to place, you definitely want *something* to carry it in.

It is simply gorgeous. Hundreds of distinct characters, each acting individually and with his or her own look. You start by playing a cocky female fighter. I liked this a lot - the character, while a bit revealing in the chest area, actually wears armor and her moves are *great*. The sword trails and combos are visual artistry. This is of course very similar to both the Dynasty Warriors series and the Kingdom Under Fire series. That's not bad at all, it's a genre of gameplay that I enjoy. If you haven't seen these games, think of the opening scene of Lord of the Rings. When Sauron is swinging his weapon, blowing away tons of elf and human soldiers on each sweep, that's what you get to recreate here. I did find it annoying that you have to play all the way through as a character to get to start another - I'd much rather be able to choose from a roster of characters right from the beginning. Also, I found many of the names of the characters to be quite silly. It unnecessarily drew away from the game's world. Finally, although I don't really need a huge, complex plot for games like this, at least *some* plot would have been nice. Some strategy would have been nice too. Organizing methods of attack, or who to attack first, is usually a fun part of games like this. Here, it was more just attack all, then attack all, then attack all again. To make it worse, there's no mid-level saves. So you could have racked up incredible points, and be at minute 29.5 of a 30 minute level, and one slight distraction like \"Lisa, pick up that ringing phone!\" and POOF you have to start all over again. Still, I can deal with that. The game is fun enough that I don't mind replaying a level. Getting to more characters is certainly the incentive of playing through the levels as a set. The character models are gorgeous. The animation of the actions is gorgeous. Sure, if you're not into this style of gameplay, then there are other games you can buy. But if you're a fan of the sweeping attacks and gorgeous graphics displayed here, you'll be up for a great experience!

As you might expect, some people think it is great - and others find it very limited. Many modern games come with \"level creators\", so most people who are interested in game design have given a try at putting together a level or two. You lay out the rooms, add in textures, add in a few character models and then see how things go. You quickly learn just how much actual work is involved in designing a level that is enjoyable. It's not just about adding halls and doors. It's about designing a world that seems realistic, that is fun to explore, and that provides challenges. That all being said, the toolset that you use to create your world should be as easy to use as possible. Since designers themselves often use in-house level design tools to create their own game levels, that should make sense. I'm not sure, therefore, why the RPG Maker 3 tools seem so cumbersome. Yes, the user needs to be able to think in 3D space, and yes they MUST have a keyboard. That's not an unreasonable request if you're typing in dialogue. And yes, the user needs a few memory cards! When I'm doing song creation on my home PC, I have a very large hard drive to work with. I completely expect when I'm designing games on my PS2 that I have a few memory cards to work with, to save variations of my games and keep backup copies. That all being said, the game tools should be very easy to use, well organized, and easy to see. RPG Maker 3 just doesn't seem to come through on those points. The command sets are not always intuitive. The graphics are not PS2 worthy. And the components ... You would think the actual components you had to work with would be relatively high quality. But they're not. The textures, character models, sounds, animations, and virtually every other aspect of your \"building blocks\" could really be improved. This is in essence the easiest part of the software product for them to have done right! There are trillions of character models out there in a wide variety of games. Why only provide a few stereotypical ones? PS2 developers have done some amazing things with textures and organic objects. Why give us cheezy low-rez versions? It was really rather surprising the low level of items provided with which to make your game. I am a developer and I fully realize how hard it is to create a game. I understand that the best games come from learning the actual base level language that the console understands, and to work with that. That being said, I have used MANY level generators for games which are easy to use and which provide amazingly good graphics. Usually those level generators are provided as free bonus items included with a full length regular game. For this RPG Maker to sell as a standalone software product - and to have *poorer* level generation and building blocks - makes little sense to me.

Latching onto a minor character - Vincent Valentine - we now find out what happened 3 years later. Vincent is older than the typical Final Fantasy Teen character - more along the lines of Auron from FFX. He loves to dramatically swirl his cape as he moves. He is dark, brooding, and ruthlessly efficient in his attacks. I like all of this. The cut scenes are simply *gorgeous* at times.  The movements of characters is just amazing. The small motions, the emotions shone, this is a work of art. Unfortunately, given these great achievements, the actual gameplay really doesn't hold up well for me. I understand that this is not a RPG - it is a combat game. You go around attacking enemies, little numbers of damage bounce over their heads, and you reduce them to zero. The \"world\" is a Final Fantasy world, but it's not really a Final Fantasy game. It's about building up gun components, shooting, and then shooting some more. Puzzles involve getting cards to get through doors, and figuring out how to kill enemies. The in game graphics are much less impressive than the cut scenes. Your character is reduced to jumping and walking. There's no diving, rolling, or other special moves. Even worse, there are incredibly numerous long pauses as you go between gameplay and cut scene. There must have been a better way to integrate those quickly, especially as many of the cut scenes are just brief little \"thank you\"s. Also, while I know Vincent is a dark, brooding type - a type that appeals to me a lot, by the way - I find him a bit too uncaring about the people around him. He seems often to get involved reluctantly. He almost seems to dismiss some people as being beneath his notice. This isn't a kind of hero I appreciate. In general, as much as I tried to get into this new style of game, it just didn't work very well. There are many other combat style games that involve characters that can creep, roll, dive and use great combat moves. With Vincent doing these things in cut scenes, he should be able to do them in actual gameplay as well.</td><td>Amazing cut scenes and main character - but not well developed</td><td>1157155200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>89990</td><td>1.0</td><td>20</td><td>false</td><td>09 2, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000GSM06I</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I loved the original Bomberman games. It was a great strategy game - you had to set up bomb patterns to blow out walls and destroy enemies. Then came the XBox 360 version. I was really looking forward to a fun, engrossing strategy game that I could play for hours on end. I don't mind \"dark\" games so choosing between a male and female somber, realistic looking robot didn't bother me much. You can choose from a few colors to \"highlight\" their metallic outfits as well. Then you head onto the playing grid. Suddenly the game is far less fun. I realize it's about grids, it's about thinking out your moves since you can only move at a certain speed. You have to try to lure your opponent into a trapped location so that you can blast them into oblivion. However, because of the camera angles, the unnecessary excess graphic items and the darkness, it tries to seem more like a first person shooter. The slow pace of your character, instead of being a normal part of the strategy, now seems unnecessary and annoying. You can't always see what you're trying to do. Maybe the sound could have been the saving grace - but if anything, it makes the game far, far worse. The incredibly tinny, robotic voice that gives you a status at the end of each level is perhaps the most annoying voice I have ever heard in a game. It almost makes you want to deliberately lose, so you don't have to hear the winning commentary. The irony is that usually we only buy games we really expect to want to play and replay. We rent the rest so that we can review them thoroughly, play through once, and then send the game back again. We thought this would be a keeper - we were told it'd be a lot of fun - but as it turns out we had to force ourselves to play it. If you're a fan of the Bomberman series, then there are numerous games from before the XBox 360 which are great fun to play and replay.  Get your hands on those, enjoy them for the fun puzzle worlds they provide, and avoid this misguided latest version.

A little bit combat, a little bit strategy, this provides quick, easy missions and then involving online gameplay. If you've seen mech games before, you know the basic idea. Big, plodding robots with legs, tracks or wheels. Lots of weapons and armor to plunk onto the mech in lego-like fashion. Enemies and buildings to blow up, while staying alive. Where other mech games go for arcadey non-reality, ChromeHounds tries to keep things real. Your mechs don't zip along at 100 miles an hour. They stomp with realistic weight and speed, leaving behind footprints and track marks. The detail on their glistening metal body is quite impressive. With the incredibly huge amount of customization available for your mech, you can spend hours honing the exact perfect mech for your gameplay style, and really care about its survival. The world you inhabit didn't get this same level of loving detail. The missions are all very short and really don't need a plot. You are blowing things up while trying not to be blown up yourself. The environments you stomp through are almost an afterthought. Don't look for waving fields of grain or purple mountains majesty here. As in many modern combat games, the basic mission tree is really all just a training mission for the *real* challenge - facing other human beings. You want to replay the local missions several times, tuning your mech movement skills and your weapon / armor combination to get ready for the team based online gameplay. That is where the real fun and skill-testing begins. Can you coordinate your efforts with your friends to ward off attacks from other skilled players from around the world? You can't just run and blast away - that technique will get you killed quickly. You have to know your mech's limitations and advantages, and then plan joint attacks to achieve that victory. It really is a fun combination of hand-eye coordination and tactical intelligent planning. Well recommended for people who have online gameplay and enjoy that level of thought. For someone just wanting an arcadey fly-fast-and-blow-things-up-locally, you might want to rent this first to see if the realistic mech functioning will keep you happy.</td><td>Great online team gameplay</td><td>1157155200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>80835</td><td>4.0</td><td>23</td><td>false</td><td>09 2, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000F8O1C0</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Disgaea 2 is a fun, cartoony combination of RPG and tactical game. You are Adell, a young fighter, who pairs up with Rozalin in order to defeat the evil Zenon. You build up a party of characters, including fighters, healers, and pretty much any monster type you defeat in battle. As you wander through the lands, you often find monsters to conquer. During these battles, you end up on a grid. Each character can move a certain distance per turn, to get around and behind your enemy. In some ways the game is like a typical RPG. There is an evil main boss to conquer. There are various smaller enemies along the way. There are power-ups to collect and weapons to buy. The graphics are not meant to be realistic or cutting edge. They are casual, cute, and fun. Disgaea really shines in its humor. It's not meant for the really little - its characters joke about looking up girls' skirts and there are swears such as \"kick their ass\". Still, the game is generally very family friendly and has a ton of fun in it. Most of the villagers have been turned into demons and have quite wild personality changes. The main character - Adell - is still human. When you go around talking to the other people, one muses why Adell is still human. \"Is it because he's the main character\"? Rozalin, Zenon's daughter, is a very spoiled, stuck-up teen girl and her dialogue is quite funny. Many flaws of other games have been taken care of here. When you go into shops, they have new items each time, giving you a selection to choose from that you will find interesting. You can customize new characters, creating a party that is just perfect for your gaming style. The voices are cutesy in the traditional anime style, and the sounds fit in well with the world. The plot is fairly involved and really draws you along. Again, this isn't a dark, serious story of angst and power. It's a fun, light-hearted romp through a fun fantasy world, where you can play for a few hours, save, and pick up the story the next time you have free time.

This is the ultimate episode where Anakin finally turns to the dark side and embraces his new personae as Darth Vader. The translation into a game was done with the full cooperation of the Star Wars people, and there are many integrations of video clips into the storyline. I've seen this done VERY well with other games, so that you feel you're an integral part of the storyline. Unfortunately, with the XBox engine, this just doesn't work as well in this game. When you switch from the movie back into gameplay, the characters suddenly look very wooden and blocky. I don't think you'd have that reaction at all if 1) they didn't try to make it a seamless situation or 2) they'd done a better job with in game graphics. The movement of the characters during fighting is relatively smooth, with the saber attacks, spins, jumps and so on. The problem here is that much of what you're doing is repetitive. Oh look, another wave of droids to slaughter. It often comes down to button mashing, which is a shame because in an RPG like manner you get to build up your character's strengths to customize him. I also have to comment that the dialogue gets very inane, very quickly. I realize they can't \"fix\" Anakin to make him more pleasant - but it's like water torture to hear his snotty voice snapping back at Kenobi constantly. It was very nice of them to have two player gameplay, something which is missing from a lot of games. But on the other hand, why don't they have an XBox Live component? With so many people who play on Live - but don't have nearby friends to play in the house - it's a real shame. I know many people who are home taking care of kids or for other reasons can't have someone else \"in\" their house, and Live is an important aspect of their free time fun. Finally, there were situations in the game where you hit a \"puzzle to be solved\" and you were given quick instructions about what button to press - but if you missed those for some reason, you were doomed to death so that you could go back and replay up to that area and hear the instructions again.

As in the previous games, your actions determine your look and the look of the world around you. You start out as a lad in a village, doing random quests for your village. You can choose to do those quests nicely or cruelly, changing your reputation as you go. The townspeople react to your new reputation. The village is soon torched by bandits and you go off to a guild hall to become a Hero, to get revenge. The game is very open ended, letting you choose which quests you wish, roam around slaying beasts, hang out in the pubs playing pub games, getting drunk. You can get married, get divorced and slay people. As you set your course in life, and choose clothing and armor, people react to you with pleasure, fear, appreciation, laughter, and more. The graphics are stellar in this game. Trees have leaves of different types. Smoke rises from the glowing forge, the game cycles from day to night as you adventure. Your character can wear hairstyles and tattoos, changing clothes to suit the occasion. The sounds are great as well. You hear hoot-owls at night, sparrows during the day. People sleep and snore at night, while kids arond during the day. Amongst it all, a gentle classical musical score puts you into the medieval frame of mind. There are the traditional elements of an RPG here - you slay creatures, solve quests, earn money and reputation. You use experience to build up the skills in the area you enjoy - magic, ranged weapons, hand to hand combat. If you choose good things to do, the people love you and your look and atmosphere is one of joy. If you choose evil things, the townspeople run in fear, you sprout horns and even get a bug-swarm near you. But the true joy of this game is where it lets you pretty much do whatever you want. You can marry a girl - then kill her off for her inheritance. Or kill off her parents. Or divorce her and marry another one. The choices are pretty much endless, and since every person in the game related to each other one and to you, you never know what the various combinations will cause to happen. This is NOT a quick game to win. It will take you some time to get through the intro / tutorial areas and really learn the basics. Once you do, the gameplay itself can easily take weeks to months to try out everything, if it is even possible to try everything. You'll want to create several characters to be able to try the world as good, evil and everything in between. Also note this is a MATURE title and lists in its \"things you've done\" items like \"getting drunk\" and \"having sex\" and so on. You run into situations with cheating husbands, cheating wives, etc. This isn't meant for the younger set. Still, for adults it can be great fun.

Dynasty Warriors 4 is a cult classic with great graphics and a combination of button-mashing fighting and strategy. The graphics in Dynasty Warriors 4 are REALLY impressive. Maybe not in a Splinter Cell sort of way, but the facial movements in the cut scenes, the body movements during sword attacks, the fields of reeds and rolling plains are quite impressive for the PS2. The game is in essence the same as previous Dynasty Warrior games, but greatly enhanced. You are a General in China during a rebellion of the Han Dynasty. The Yellow Turbans sought to bring a time of peace by overthrowing the Han dynasty, and of course the Hans resisted! The well done encyclopedia fills you in on all the factual background of the locations, events, and personalities involved in this series of battles. You can customize your own character - male or female - down to the color of the outfit and style of armor worn. You can customize the bodyguards that protect you.  You can play around in duels or skill contests. But the real fun is when you head into the main campaign. Each level is huge and involves a variety of terrain and landscapes. There are numerous generals each with large number of forces under his or her control. Luckily you're not alone in this - you have fellow generals and tons of troops under your control. An overview map keeps track of where each main force is, and within that you are hacking and slashing your way to victory. It seems a bit overwhelming at first - is this a strategy overview, a first person slayer or a combo of both? Once you get into it, though, it's quite easy to understand and extremely addictive. You can't hurt your own forces. It's very reassuring to see your bodyguards hanging out nearby and taking out enemies. The map and status bar help you keep track of the tides of war. You gather up powers and health from fallen enemies and nearby barrels. The combo attacks and powerup attacks are great! Your weapons gain levels, your loyal troops get stronger, and you really feel like you've accomplished something of worth when you get through these historical sequences and stand with your troops, battle hardened, at the end of the road.

You practice with a bunch of mini-games, then you take a test to see just how hot your brain really is. While it can be fun, there isn't enough variety to make it the long term draw that Brain Age is. First, the basics. You're in a brain lab where testing has shown that the more you use your brain, the more blood flow that goes through it. It makes sense, and I like this concept MUCH more than the bizarre ideal that \"everyone should want to have a 20-year-old brain\" that Brain Age supports. A well exercised brain is a healthy, happy and functional brain. There are five categories of brain tests and exercises for you to play with. You can play with logic, memory, math, language and concentration. The types of games you play are pretty typical for this type of game. You play Simon type remember-the-sequence games. You look at a series of shapes and figure out what comes next. You choose numbers in order of low to high. You alphabetize words. I think we have really been spoiled by the Brain Age series, though. Many of the Brain Age games are really fun to play. I admit some I dislike, but most are good. Here, though, they are all pretty boring. I like the shape assembly game, and the yarn following game is fun enough, but many of the others just aren't fun. In fact, one - the \"what rhymes with this shape\" - provides shapes that are completely unrecognizable! How can I tell what rhymes with an object I can't identify? Another problem, oddly enough, is the graphics. At first I was really impressed by the graphics and was thinking I would love the game because of it. Brain Age is notoriously poor on graphics. But after playing for a while, it became clear that in many cases the graphics are just there for the sake of being there - and added a LOT of loading time that was completely unnecessary. Let's say I wanted to work on concentration games. So I'd go through a sequence of clicks and loading screens to see the elevator going down to that \"floor\" - and images of rotating brains and so on to get to a game. Once I finish the game, it sends me back to the main level - and I have to do the entire sequence again to get to another test! I looked for ways to turn off these cut scene sequences and couldn't find any. You're just stuck with them. Also, Brain Age really encourages you to come back daily. It has daily charts and graphs, welcome messages, and more. There are fun, random, creative daily puzzles that you want to come back and see the results of. You can compare your results with friends playing on the same machine, which encourages a friendly competition. You don't have any of that here. You do have a graph of your overall brain heat over time, but that's it. The most you can do is retake a given mini-game to try to better your score in it. But it's not easy to scan them to see what you want to work on. Never mind that you'd have to trudge through various loading screens to get there. There was a huge amount of potential here. If they'd tested some more, they might have realized how old those loading screens get after a while, added more multi-person comparisons, and jazzed up the games a bit. I suppose if you have a PSP and not a DS, this is certainly better than nothing. Maybe with luck they'll come out with a sequel that builds on this base and adds in the other functionality.</td><td>Great Intentions - but Bad Navigation</td><td>1190073600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>22806</td><td>5.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>09 18, 2005</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00005BZCA</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Shrek 2 was an amazingly funny movie, with all of the wit and graphic animation of the first. The game Shrek 2 is obviously geared towards kids, but is great fun too. The game lets you be one of four characters - Shrek, Fiona, Donkey and the Gingerbread Man. Each character has his or her strengths and weaknesses, and the graphics are rather nicely done. Shrek lands with a hard THUD, Fiona floats gently to the ground, and so on. You can play multi-player, or solo, easily switching between characters if you wish. This is great for family play, where parents can hop in to help out with a difficult puzzle, or just wander along behind the child to be there in case of trouble. Most of the game is about collecting items and solving simple puzzles. You slam on snails to get them out of their shells and get eyeballs. You slow down time so you can gather up the fairies. All along, there are fun jokes and riddles to keep you entertained. Not all games have to be high brainpower puzzles or super-fast lightning reflex challenges. Sometimes it's nice to have a simple game that kids can really enjoy. I'm really pleased that this game is out there. Highly recommended for the younger set, and parents might actually enjoy playing along with the tykes.</td><td>Perfect fun for the younger set</td><td>1127001600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>5738</td><td>5.0</td><td>37</td><td>false</td><td>09 18, 2000</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00001ZWP8</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Not all strategy games are blood and gore, unsuitable for youngsters.  Harvest Moon does require some strategic thinking, but is great for tykes  that need something low key and non-violent to play. The premise is a  sad one - you are an orphan boy which must take over your grandfather's  farm. You have a pet dog, but that's it - everything else is up to you. Off  to work! You must determine how best to keep your farm running. Should  you plant eggplant or potatoes? Spend your time fishing or milking cows?  The better you do, the more you earn, and the more seeds you can buy or  chickens you can raise. It's not all work. There are festivals to attend  and pretty girls to talk to. You can upgrade your home with a second floor  or with a cradle. Choose a girl to marry, and maybe your house will become  a happy home with a growing family. Your chickens, cows, and even horse  will share in the fun. Seasons go by, rain comes and goes, your skills  improve and you might even win a horserace. Even those too young to grasp  the strategy involved will still enjoy watching the plants grow and riding  the horse around.

It's campy as heck, and fun for a little while. It doesn't have much lasting value though. In \"Monster Madness\", up to four players take the role of teenagers fighting to defend themselves against hordes of zombies and monsters. There are, accordingly, four characters - the nerd, the goth girl, the stoner, and the blonde. Each has their own special weapon, though the stages are littered with more generic improvised weapons that every player can use - furniture, power tools, guns, etc. Weapons can also be upgraded by finding tools and money in levels. Gameplay is furious and frantic, as befits the game's style. However, it's largely definable as wading through seas of enemies in one way or another. The game is really chaotic to the point of unrecognizability, which adds to the theme of the game but detracts from actual gameplay quality. There are bright colors to distinguish players and so on, but it still largely ends up as a big muddled mess - for better or for worse. It's clear multiplayer antics are the game's main draw, though. The graphics are okay, and the sound is at least suitable for the game's feel. The quips get old pretty quickly, but if you're the kind of person who finds them funny, it might be worth it anyways. \"Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia\" doesn't feel like a full game. It feels like a game that ought to be on the XBOX Live arcade or something. It's not bad, but it's not a full-quality game either. If you see it cheap, it could be worth picking up. As a full-price game, though, it doesn't stack up. Rating: 5/10 Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia was purchased by us from a gaming store, with our own money.

It was incredibly fun, very replayable and had a wicked sense of humor. Lego Star Wars II is just as fun, and covers Episodes IV-VI! It's very rare to find a game that kids can play, adults can play, and everybody truly loves it. This is one of those games. I'm sure kids enjoy the game quite a lot - but pretty much every adult gamer I know loves this series as well. It's fun, it has classic scenes from the Star Wars movies done in a VERY funny style, and you can keep replaying it. You can play it with friends! You can unlock new episodes, new ships, new characters, you name it. The first thing you notice when you enter the \"Cantina\" is that now you can MAKE NEW CHARACTERS!!! Yes, you can mix up Darth Vader's head, Princess Leia's torso and a stormtrooper's pants. You can mix pretty much any character you find in the game, and give them personalized names! Then you can bring 2 of your creations into the game with you on free play mode. Talk about fun!! The game gets even better. Yes, you work through all the classic scenes - Luke buying the droids, the Death Star blowing up, and so on from the \"first 3 movies\" (in release order at least). The cut scenes are VERY funny. Being able to play along as the various characters is amazingly fun in story mode, and even better in \"free play\" when you can randomly switch between a variety of characters to find all the hidden items. I love the stud finding system. You want more money? Just replay a mission a few times. You can get all sorts of fun \"cheats\" (not cheats, really, but fun add-ons), you can buy new characters to use, and much more. It really gives you incentive to keep playing. Is a youngster in the house having trouble playing? Just have an adult pop into the game for a while to help out, then the adult can pop out again, to let the child keep playing! It is just brilliant. I love this game. The graphics are superb, as last time, with little lego movements seeming just right. Their swaggers and sliders are incredibly funny. The sound, of course, is the real movie soundtrack and is superb. You couldn't ask for anything better. Even the tiny touches are funny. If C-3PO starts getting hit, he loses an arm, then another arm, then a leg. You have him hopping along valiantly behind you, trying to remain with your team. Chewie rips off arms from stormtroopers. Now of course, there are always a few things the game designers get wrong. While Chewie's arm-ripping is quite funny, it is REALLY annoying when he does it - very slowly - in the middle of a firefight when you wanted him to be blasting away. The characters automatically switch into close combat mode if they think someone is nearby, even if you really needed to fire away at someone with the blaster. Even more annoying, if you're blasting away at \"destructables\" (wall items, whatever) and your friend gets near you start bashing on him! The camera is also really annoying. You get a *slight* amount of view control, but not much. When you are craning around trying to find a mini-kit on the screen and the camera keeps swooping wildly exactly where you do NOT want to look, it can get very frustrating. Still, these are minor problems in a game that is so stellar. I highly, highly recommend this game for any gamer of any age.

It comes with a free pedometer, that you can plug into your DS! It lets you track your steps each day easily. The rest of the 'game', though, is a mixed blessing. The game is broken out into a number of areas. Each day you plug in your pedometer so it knows right away how many steps you took wearing it. I already own a pedometer which plugs into a computer, and I have to say my other one is much better. This one just counts total steps. The other one actually tracks them by hour and by intensity - so you get an instant graph of how active you were each hour, which were quiet steps, which were energetic steps and so on. It's much more helpful. You can input other activities you've done, but it's a very kludgy interface. You choose an icon of what type of general thing you did - housework, team sports etc - and then manually spin a clock dial to point at an interval. It won't even let you check the box if it's under an hour worth of effort. Then there are challenges - both food and activity related, both short term (\"do now\") and longer term (\"do by tomorrow\"). Sometimes the items are easy - hide the salt, clean out the fridge. Sometimes they are more complicated, like go out jogging. However, sometimes they are just non-doable for some people. Go jogging and don't come home until you spot an animal? Go bake some bread from scratch? Organize a team sport and get your family and friends to play? I can easily see some gamers getting frustrated by these types of challenges because they simply don't have the supplies or ability to do them in their environment. The DS will say something like \"do 20 lunges\" but give you no idea how to do them. You have to go find your manual and look it up. With other activity DS games I have, they explain the activity to you and have animated demonstrations. Even some of their \"coaching tests\" seem not quite kosher. They rate you down if you drive a car to the corner store rather than walking. Some of us don't have \"corner stores\" within safe walking distance. For daily food tracking, they don't use calories or carbs or other normal units. They use \"energy units\" which means the things you're learning will be completely unhelpful in the real world. Also, the interface is again extremely tedious. Let's say you ate a serving of turkey. You have to go paging through the general food types, find the poultry area and drag down a poultry item. It then separates into different types of poultry - turkey, chicken and breaded chicken. You drag one of the turkey items onto the person. You have to do that with every single food you eat, all day long. I definitely appreciate what it is trying to do, and I imagine most people would find it cute for a week or two, but I really don't see most users going through that tedious interface for more than that. Finally, the game is very much set up for completely sedentary people. Its idea of activity is to stand and sit 10 times. If you are not in the \"obese\" range, I am not sure their activities are really going to help you become more healthy. Even for obese people, I think there are many other better options out there to help you improve your health. Still, if you really love your DS and don't own a pedometer, this isn't a *bad* choice. I am all for people using whatever works for them. If you don't mind this interface and enjoy the little challenges, then have at it! Being active this way is far better than being inactive.

It is just amazing how encompassing this game is. We just hit 100% on the entire game and have to say it was a lot of fun to get through it. In a world where games can be won and ended in a day or two, it is so satisfying to have a games that literally lasts weeks and is fun from start to finish. The humor in these Lego games is amazing. The little looks, the interactions are so funny. Whoever creates these games really should get a lot of credit for it. You get sucked into the story, become fond of the characters and really enjoy the ride. You get all three Indiana Jones moves in here - with detailed scene by scene recreations. In addition there are extra levels for Young Indiana Jones and the traditional smash-all-you-can level as well. There are tons of in-jokes - many characters from Star Wars make appearances in here. The basic operation of the game is that you and a friend (or a computer AI) go romping through a Lego recreation of a given scene from the movie. Maybe you're running to escape a giant rolling ball. Maybe you're wandering around a mysterious library looking to create a letter X. Whatever it is, you bash everything you see, breaking the Lego pieces apart, earning coins to then buy new characters, special unlocks, and much more. There are puzzles to solve, enemies to bash, but it's all in good fun. It's not violent (although I suppose some might say that having a little Indiana Jones take his whip and cause a little tribesman to fall into Lego component parts is violent). It's not just a game for kids - as adults, my boyfriend and I have had great fun with both Lego games. It's neat that a second player can \"pop in\" at any time, play along for a while to help out, and then \"pop out\" again. I would love to see more movies go through the Lego process.

It comes with a free pedometer, that you can plug into your DS! It lets you track your steps each day easily. The rest of the 'game', though, is a mixed blessing. The game is broken out into a number of areas. Each day you plug in your pedometer so it knows right away how many steps you took wearing it. I already own a pedometer which plugs into a computer, and I have to say my other one is much better. This one just counts total steps. The other one actually tracks them by hour and by intensity - so you get an instant graph of how active you were each hour, which were quiet steps, which were energetic steps and so on. It's much more helpful. You can input other activities you've done, but it's a very kludgy interface. You choose an icon of what type of general thing you did - housework, team sports etc - and then manually spin a clock dial to point at an interval. It won't even let you check the box if it's under an hour worth of effort. Then there are challenges - both food and activity related, both short term (\"do now\") and longer term (\"do by tomorrow\"). Sometimes the items are easy - hide the salt, clean out the fridge. Sometimes they are more complicated, like go out jogging. However, sometimes they are just non-doable for some people. Go jogging and don't come home until you spot an animal? Go bake some bread from scratch? Organize a team sport and get your family and friends to play? I can easily see some gamers getting frustrated by these types of challenges because they simply don't have the supplies or ability to do them in their environment. The DS will say something like \"do 20 lunges\" but give you no idea how to do them. You have to go find your manual and look it up. With other activity DS games I have, they explain the activity to you and have animated demonstrations. Even some of their \"coaching tests\" seem not quite kosher. They rate you down if you drive a car to the corner store rather than walking. Some of us don't have \"corner stores\" within safe walking distance. For daily food tracking, they don't use calories or carbs or other normal units. They use \"energy units\" which means the things you're learning will be completely unhelpful in the real world. Also, the interface is again extremely tedious. Let's say you ate a serving of turkey. You have to go paging through the general food types, find the poultry area and drag down a poultry item. It then separates into different types of poultry - turkey, chicken and breaded chicken. You drag one of the turkey items onto the person. You have to do that with every single food you eat, all day long. I definitely appreciate what it is trying to do, and I imagine most people would find it cute for a week or two, but I really don't see most users going through that tedious interface for more than that. Finally, the game is very much set up for completely sedentary people. Its idea of activity is to stand and sit 10 times. If you are not in the \"obese\" range, I am not sure their activities are really going to help you become more healthy. Even for obese people, I think there are many other better options out there to help you improve your health. Still, if you really love your DS and don't own a pedometer, this isn't a *bad* choice. I am all for people using whatever works for them. If you don't mind this interface and enjoy the little challenges, then have at it! Being active this way is far better than being inactive.

It is just amazing how encompassing this game is. We just hit 100% on the entire game and have to say it was a lot of fun to get through it. In a world where games can be won and ended in a day or two, it is so satisfying to have a games that literally lasts weeks and is fun from start to finish. The humor in these Lego games is amazing. The little looks, the interactions are so funny. Whoever creates these games really should get a lot of credit for it. You get sucked into the story, become fond of the characters and really enjoy the ride. You get all three Indiana Jones moves in here - with detailed scene by scene recreations. In addition there are extra levels for Young Indiana Jones and the traditional smash-all-you-can level as well. There are tons of in-jokes - many characters from Star Wars make appearances in here. The basic operation of the game is that you and a friend (or a computer AI) go romping through a Lego recreation of a given scene from the movie. Maybe you're running to escape a giant rolling ball. Maybe you're wandering around a mysterious library looking to create a letter X. Whatever it is, you bash everything you see, breaking the Lego pieces apart, earning coins to then buy new characters, special unlocks, and much more. There are puzzles to solve, enemies to bash, but it's all in good fun. It's not violent (although I suppose some might say that having a little Indiana Jones take his whip and cause a little tribesman to fall into Lego component parts is violent). It's not just a game for kids - as adults, my boyfriend and I have had great fun with both Lego games. It's neat that a second player can \"pop in\" at any time, play along for a while to help out, and then \"pop out\" again. I would love to see more movies go through the Lego process. How about Lego Lord of the Rings? That would be incredible :) Until then, though, I definitely recommend Lego Indiana Jones.

That's not to say that it's too big to bring with you! It's just that, at 472 pages, this provides by far the most information on the Las Vegas destination. It covers far more hotels, restaurants, golf courses, spas, etc. than any other book I have. I love the charts in this book. One chart shows you every hotel in the area with the type of food, entertainment, pool, exercise room, etc. that they have. You can quickly scan and see which ones meet your needs. They've got reviews of the various nightclubs, describing what they are like in rather good detail. The reviews aren't about everyone should go here! They clearly lay out who would enjoy, and who would not enjoy, the particular atmosphere. There are general restaurant reviews, plus a few best of if you're seeking a particular kind of food. The reviews of the shows are really good, and give you a great sense of what is good and not-so-good about each one. If there's a downside with this book, it's that it focusses ONLY on Vegas - it doesn't go into the surrounding areas very much. But heck, the book is almost 500 pages long!! It does incredible justice to the city and really tells you everything you could want to know about enjoying your time there. If you want a book on other areas, go ahead and buy one. But if you want a book on Vegas itself, this is going to give you what you seek.</td><td>Best of the Vegas Books - Highly Recommended</td><td>1126656000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>63264</td><td>3.0</td><td>7</td><td>false</td><td>09 13, 2007</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0007OGDHS</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Indigo Prophecy deserves kudos for thinking outside of the box. This merges an adventure game, a thrilling crime drama and reflex action together. Unfortunately, the results are a bit sporatic. First, the basics. You are an innocent man - but somehow you wake up standing over a dead body, knife in hand. Obviously you killed him - but why? You're not the only person asking this question. You can switch between three other characters in order to solve this crime. The game is a \"movie\". The tutorial takes place in a green room situation where you learn how to move and interact. There are flashbacks, thought-overs, foreshadowing and many other movie gimmicks. If you love movies, this is great. It helps to immerse you in the feeling that you are interacting in an epic situation. There is a lot of dialogue here, and you lead it along. You have a series of options you can choose from, and depending on what direction you choose to go in, the storyline follows you. In that sense, the game is really quite open and you can have a great impact on what happens. All of these situations are great in theory. The practice is a bit different. For starters, the game's graphics are really not that wonderful. I realize that in many games it doesn't matter - but this is supposed to be a gritty crime drama. With all the amazing XBox games out there, to then go \"backwards\" to this one is quite noticeable. It detracts from gameplay to have pixellated objects to interact with when you're talking about human lives on the line. The game, for all of its freedom of choice, is very linear. It starts right from the beginning. You're in your apartment, evading the cops. You want to hide a bloody item of clothing and do up the bed. But wait - you can't pull out your blankets if you're holding something in your hand! You can't put that item down either. So you have to run across the room to the washing machine - put it in - then run back to the bed and pull that across. They have a set order they expect you to do things in. If you don't, you keep failing and restarting until you get it right. The movement makes this doubly difficult. You enter a room and forward is up. Go into another room and forward is left. The cameras don't follow with you naturally. It adds extra frustration to the constant restart cycle. The game design is very innovative. Again, I praise them for thinking outside the box and creating this rich, dramatic environment. However, they should have spent a few more months in testing and design, so that the rest of the game was brought up to those same standards. Don't get me started on the left-left-right-up-right sequences required in order to do certain tasks ... Note: this does play on the XBox 360.</td><td>Great Concept but Needed More Testing</td><td>1189641600</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>20631</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>09 13, 2002</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000051QDD</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Installing this adapter couldn't be any easier.

There are few that really grab a tight hold of me ... but this was definitely one. As soon as it came out, I bought one copy for me and another as a present for a relative. That night I was up until 5am playing my couple - a criminal and a psychic - and building them up in career. Blearily I trudged to bed, dreaming of my Sims. The next night I promised myself I'd show a little more self control. I created a musician sim - in a fit of amusement I chose Britney Spears - and a partner in a Robin Hood outfit. She started playing on her electric guitar, and the Sim-friends that came by booed their fool heads off. A few hours later, she was ripping amazing riffs on her tiny instrument, and the Sim-buddies were now dancing around the living room. It was amazing. The wealth of new outfits for your sims, and objects to buy them, is just fantastic. Pets. Giant lights. Interesting, pretty doodads. The gorgeous new 60s windows and wallpaper, plus the gothic candelabras, arrow-slit windows, and even a robot make this an incredible enhancement. They've got fun jobs available, too. Want to be a Shooting Star in musical fame and glory? How about a slacker (think golf caddy) or hacker, or psychic or more? They're all there, each with their own outfits and career ladders. But wait, it even gets better. You can have MULTIPLE NEIGHBORHOODS. Now, since a given Sim family often needs 15 or more friends to get to the higher levels, the original game was pretty much one-person-only. You couldn't have multiple people use your computer, because there were a limited number of house lots to go around. The houses were simply needed for the Sim-Pals to live in (in groups of 8 of course). With the new system, each person who wants to play can have their very own neighborhood, where they grow and live to their heart's content. Sure, there are still a few bugs. Probably the most glaring one is the annoying lack of pathfinding ability. My psychic lost her job when she'd already gotten to Medium status because she was trapped in the bathroom. The maid and an unruly guest blocked both entrances, and I didn't blast a hole in the wall fast enough. In another scenario, a guest came into my kitchen, faced the fall, and refused to move. She in fact fell asleep against the wall. Once again, I had to make a hole in my house for her to escape. Pathfinding aside, though, the game is enormously addictive and I haven't been to bed before 3am since it has entered the house. The person to whom I gave it as a gift is experiencing the exact same problem. Sure, you can argue, is a high-school-band-teacher *really* a step up from being a lounge singer? By the time you're a Rock Star, with a huge pool and a bar in your back yard, you don't really care.

We teach girls that they can cry when they're sad, talk about their feelings, and share experiences with each other. We teach boys that they need to 'buck up' and be manly, to hide the tears, to face it like a man, to be the rock on which the females can rely. It is no surprise that these lessons affect adults, and affect how male and females relate (or fail to relate) to each other. In essence, a few core themes run through the book, being supported by various examples, and different wording that help make the points clear. First, men are goal-oriented, internalizing, and when they are stressed, retreat to a cave to consider what to do. They want to come to a solution on their own, and *then* emerge. To try to help them while they are in the cave is counter productive. Men want to be trusted and admired. This is the whole Knight-in-Armor, John Wayne, Rambo training we have given men. They want to feel that the woman believes in them. To question a man is to show your doubt. The book recommends if your man is lost while driving, or forgets something while travelling, to just be quiet and accept it. It will show your trust in him to get there eventually or to solve the problem. I'm personally not sure if tihs is always wise advice. Women, on the other hand, are nurturing, expressive, feeling individuals who tend to use poetic license such as saying you ALWAYS forget to do that chore or you NEVER listen to me. The advice given to men is to take what women say with a grain of salt, and not to react to any of it literally. Most of what women want, according to the book, is just to be heard. Women don't want solutions or answers. They want to feel that their feelings are being heard and understood ... they want to be held and be told Yes, yes, I understand. The book explains that men make the mistake of thinking women tell them things in order for the men to *fix* those things. Instead, the women tell them things in order to share their feelings, but aren't seeking actual resolutions. While I agree that women are trained to share feelings and to sometimes be overly emotional, to tell a man that women never want resolutions, and always exaggerate, is not treating a woman as a logical human being perfectly capable of wanting answers. There is definitely a lot of helpful information in the book. It is of course good to show trust in your husband. It is important to understand what your wife *means* and not just pick apart what she literally has *said*. It is good to understand that society trains men to retreat to consider problems, and that they consider interference during this time as harassment instead of helpful. It's good to realize that women have emotional cycles and can sometimes be happy, and sometimes sad, and that nobody is always happy. However, be sure to read the book as a guideline on how to help your relationship, and not as a Bible which has the exact ways in which you and your special partner can relate to each other. It definitely has interesting hints and tips, and interesting stories to share. It also has many generalizations that, for many individuals, simply do not apply.</td><td>Good Guidelines, but Not a Final Word</td><td>1000339200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>53010</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 12, 2007</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00019HNN2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The Chronicles of Riddick : Escape From Butcher Bay lets fans of Pitch Black and The Chronicles Of Riddick expand the storyline. This takes place before those two movies - and you're fighting your way out of prison. First, let's point out the MATURE rating and that this involves very nasty prison fighting. Parents who are buying this for young teens who enjoy the relatively mild movies might be in for a shock. Please keep in mind that the game was made and is rated for a mature audience. They did that for a reason. Now, if you're a mature game player who doesn't mind blood and violence, you're in for a treat. Vin Diesel may not be a hallowed Shakespearian actor, but he does have his great moments, and his acting and voice work on this game are dead on. His nuances and movements translate extremely well into the gameplay. You really do feel like you're taking part in a \"new movie\". I find this much more satisfying than to replay scenes in an existing movie, when you know what is going to happen. By making this a prequel, you actually care about what is happening and wonder what's going to go on next. The plot does get you intrigued. The gameplay is what you'd probably expect from an \"escape from prison\" type of a game - sneaking around, killing off enemies, solving puzzles to get past this door or that obstacle.  Riddick can of course see in the dark, which gives some fun new twists on the usual progress of the game. The graphics are really quite nice, so your peering and sneaking don't involve trying to figure out which pixel is supposed to represent a light switch. On the downside, they didn't develop out a long, complex storyline here. You can probably finish the game in a weekend if you spend the time playing it. With all the games out there for the same price that you can play for months and months, it seems a bit odd that a modern gamemaker would put out a game that is this short. Once they have the \"hard work\" done - designing the interface, designing the models for the characters - then creating new levels and dialogue is really very easy. If they'd spent another month or so on fleshing out the game, it would have been superb.

You try to get back to your family and friends, and sort out what is going on. The RPG is very much like Final Fantasy set in a Star Trek universe. In fact they even have the code of non-interference - if a planet is a low-tech planet, you cannot interfere with its development by handing technology to it. Of course this becomes a main plot point. You can have 3 characters in your party at a time, as you wander around towns and dungeons, watching the snow fall or rain streak. The graphics are quite nice, from the medieval style towns to futuristic spaceships. Lighting effects add to the realism. Even the menus are easy to read and navigate. On the other hand, half of the females wear clothes intended to show off their skin - even when it's snowing out. Can't there be an RPG with women in NORMAL clothing? Like all RPGs you spend time creating new items, building up characters and battling to gain experience. The combat is real time which is great for people with good reflexes but can be tough on those who would rather strategize and think through what they are doing. The music ranges from great to iffy.

You also learn a lesson about power and consequences. The game is very Final Fantasy-like with a character running around a map, solving quests and learning things as he builds up skills. Your party here contains up to three characters. This is a futuristic world where humanity is living underground. As in every story from Metropolis on forward, it's the dregs of humans which are living down at the lowest levels. They are so far from the surface that they don't believe there is a real \"sky\" up there. Like many other RPGs, when you clear a dungeon, the enemies stay dead. That makes sense to me :) It does mean, though, that you can't \"bulk up infinitely\". You are given a certain number of potential XP and have to best develop your character based on that. When you become advanced enough, you gain the ability to turn into an uber-dragon. You might think this would make the rest of the game easy. But with great power comes great responsibility, or so says Spiderman. The balance here is that using that power hastens the end of the game. If you wimp out and just use your dragon powers too much, the timer counts down and the game ends. Some people complain because they get their hands on that dragon power and want to just use it to blast through the harder levels. But the whole point of the dragon power is that it is an ultimate power that should only be used for the final bosses. If you can't resist using that power all the time, then you pay the penalty. I think it's a brilliant lesson and find it fascinating that a number of gamers aren't understanding it. The characters and plot are very well done, and really get you to understand how trapped and doomed the \"lower classes\" are. The cut scene graphics are great anime style, and the in-game graphics are quite nice too. The music varies from area to area and really gives a sense of the atmosphere in the game. I enjoyed both the roaming-around gameplay and the battle gameplay as easy to understand but full of strategy. Battle especially gives you a lot of customization so you can tweak your characters to best match your gameplay style. Yes, this is NOT an easy RPG. People who try to take the 'easy way out' (i.e. dragon blasting everything) will not be able to finish the game. Players who try to race from start to finish will simply not finish. But players who put in the time to customize the characters, and who work on developing their skills, will find an amazingly fun RPG that is quite replayable.

The game casts you as one of General Custer's cavalrymen at Little Bighorn. After the famous ambush is sprung and your fellows are cut down, an armored soldier bursts from a time portal and rescues you from certain death. Erased from history and saved from your fate, your role becomes that of a time policeman. In the actual game, this means you alternate between going back between two main time periods: the Eastern Front of World War I, and the Battle of Antietam in the American Civil War. There isn't really a far-reaching time travel aspect; those time periods are basically all you get to see. The game's gunplay handles pretty well. You use a lot of period weaponry to maintain your disguise as a denizen of that time; in the Civil War, you're using muskets and revolvers, while in World War 1 you have more powerful bolt-action rifles. However, you also have the option of using future weapons, when you can get them; the rarity of these weapons shows their power, as an assault rifle or shotgun can make a battle much easier than it would normally be. Oddly, though, nobody ever notices you using these weapons, which makes one wonder why the Time Police bother to send you in the past with historically accurate weapons. Your mission objectives range from the linear (\"go forward, attack enemies at this location\") to the open-ended (\"sneak around and plant locator beacons in a German camp\"). The game does a good job with atmospheric stuff; forests and cornfields are dense and give feelings of being in a tightly-enclosed area where enemy attacks can happen at any moment. The actual battles are pretty cover-intensive, too, primarily when you have primitive weapons. Using Civil War-era guns means that you have to reload very often (after every shot in the case of muskets), so finding cover is an important part of the game. There is an active reload system similar to Gears of War that allows for faster reloading (and your gun jams if you screw it up), so reloading isn't entirely tedious. One of the only Time Travel-related gameplay points is the existence of Important People. These are otherwise normal enemies who have blue auras around them; this aura means that killing them will upset the timestream, and therefore you must shoot to wound (hitting either the arms or legs). If you avoid killing these people, then you will end up with more upgrade points to increase weapon stats. However, if you do kill those people, rival time-travelers will use the distortion of time to find you and try to kill you. Killing these enemies, though, will allow you to take their futuristic weapons for your own use. Therefore, if you're in a pinch, they can serve both as a handy armory and a nasty enemy. The graphics are okay, but not great. They look a few years outdated, but not in such an obnoxious way as to detract from the game as a whole. The sound is pretty good in some respects (gunshot noises, environmental noises) and not so great in others (voice acting). On the whole, Darkest of Days is a decent game - not great, not revolutionary, but pretty well made overall. The time travel thing doesn't get used as much as it ought to, but it provides some interesting levels, at least. The most annoying part of the game, though, was the fact that before and after every mission you're trapped in an unskippable cutscene where a computer screen talks at you. These sequences, reminiscent of similar ones in Half Life 2, belied the fact that the story was actually pretty one-dimensional, and mission briefings were unimportant due to the fact that your map just tells you where to go and what to do. As a whole, Darkest of Days gets a 7/10.</td><td>A lot of potential, doesn't quite reach it</td><td>1252627200</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>57688</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 11, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0002B90OE</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>In the Street Fighter Anniversary Collection you get to play both Street Fighter II - Turbo and Street Fighter III - Third Strike. First, realize that this set lets you play OLD versions of Street Fighter. So you have to expect lower quality graphics and sound than modern games have. It's a way to let you see the origins of this series, and to see how far the game has come in only a few years. That being said, it is actually quite fun to play these games. Street Fighter II Turbo has a cartoony feel to the characters, who only move left and right against stationary backgrounds. You might get an elephant trunk to curl occasionally, but that's about it. The characters are reasonably detailed, and most are white males with an occasional girl or monster thrown in. The moves are fun but have very basic animations. There are only a few voices that all characters share. With Street Fighter III, you get a pretty impressive upgrade in graphics. The characters are much more anime-like with smooth attacks. The characters in general are fluid, with moving belts and fabric. The backgrounds are more detailed, with flying birds and moving people.  It is still a left-right fighter but gameplay is much more enjoyable. The sound in the levels is themed to each level and gets you in the mood. I do get annoyed by the entry screen music which is loud and rappy, but luckily you don't have to listen to that for long. There are more women available on this version, and the characters in general are ones you can feel a connection with instead of looking at them as random pixel people. There are bonus stages and grading to enhance replayability. In one bonus stage, you beat up on a SUV! While I only play Street Fighter II occasionally for historical interest, Street Fighter III is quite fun even in modern times and is great either alone to beat your previous scores or against a friend for head to head fun. And you can't beat the low price!</td><td>Great classic fun that still pleases</td><td>1094860800</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>58658</td><td>4.0</td><td>38</td><td>false</td><td>09 11, 2004</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B0002IASJ8</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Phantom Brave is a story-driven RPG broken into 20 chapters. In it you play Marona, a 13 yr old girl who can talk with phantoms. She goes on quests with her phantom-pal Ash. I have to say I was disappointed with the graphics in this game when it began, as you sit through the entry cut-scenes involving Marona's parents and Ash. Both parents die, leaving Marona an orphan at age 5. You then jump forward in time to her at 13, living alone on an island with phantom-pal Ash. The island is her home which she hopes to someday buy. In the meantime, she works with her phantom friends to solve problems for people. Unfortunately, while some people need her skills, most resent her for her strange powers. The graphics are on the cute-anima-short-people side, much like Ragnarok. The backgrounds are a bit blocky. The sound is also on the cute side, with bouncy music humming along. The RPG aspect of the game is actually quite interesting. In most RPGs you just get one or two friends to travel with you. Here you get a wide selection of phantoms to work with, each with his or her own skills. You can name the phantoms and really build a party that works well with your gaming style. Not only do you have phantoms to work with, but you can \"confine\" objects on the battlefield and use them as weapons. Each item has its own special skills - and when you merge an item with a given phantom, the combination can range from so-so to truly incredible based on the match. Strangely, while much of this game seems very much geared towards kids with its cute look and feel, there are also scenes of blood-dripping monsters, characters yelling out \"what the hell is this?\" and words like \"blasphemous\" being tossed arond. The in-game help is reasonably good and while it can be confusing to get started, once you get the hang of things it's not hard to work with your party and move through the levels. On the other hand, the game starts throwing around characters, groups and political situations without much introduction. It's the type of game that may seem quite confusing the first time through - and only begins to make sense when you play it the second time around and know the players and factions. The game is pretty heavy-handed with the \"everyone picks on the 13 yr old\" and \"she is blithely happy no matter what happens around her\" scenarios. There is also a sappy voice-over that comes from nowhere to fill in the details. A fun RPG for anime fans and those who love playing with combinations and tweaking to see what works best - but be aware of the cuteness / sappy factor. Some people love that ... and some will be drive crazy.</td><td>A cute RPG with interesting combo-ability</td><td>1094860800</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>43498</td><td>5.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>09 11, 2003</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00008H2IU</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>While Soul Caliber II is great on all platforms, the special character and controller layout really make the XBox version the best of the bunch. \"Soul Caliber II\", for the Gamecube, Xbox, and Playstation 2, is a weapon-based fighting game. It is the sequel to Soul Caliber for the Sega Dreamcast. It has beautiful graphics, a comprehensive storyline, and some great moves. The basic story of the game is that there is this evil sword, called Soul Edge. Many want the sword for its great power. It is said to be, in fact, the most powerful sword in the world. However, most people don't know that it is evil, and so many pursue it. The current wielder of it is a mysterious black-armored knight named Nightmare. He was once a bandit, leader of a group called Der Schwarzwind (The Black Wind). He found Soul Edge, but gradually it took over his body. In the last game, Soul Edge was shattered by its opposite, the spirit sword Soul Caliber. However, the broken fragments of the sword have shown up in many places. Some seek to destroy the pieces to prevent the sword from regaining its evil power. Some want it to use to destroy their enemies. Some want it for the power it brings. However, everybody wants it, and most have no quarrel with destroying everyone in their way to get it. There is a huge selection of characters, with six secret characters adding to the lineup. They vary from a Japanese swordsman to a village mystic to a female ninja demon hunter to a diabolical golem to an undead tomb guardian. There are also a great variety of stages, including a windmill in a mountainous village, an abandoned yet well-preserved Japanese castle, and a lakeside garden. Most of these places have at least one place where a fighter can be knocked out of the ring (except for the cage matches), so knocking someone out or tossing them out is a vital strategy for winning. The modes of play that you can do include arcade mode, in which you fight several random enemies and one character-based enemy in order to accomplish your character's goal, Weapon Master Mode, in which you can earn gold to buy extra weapons, costumes, and artwork, to various time attack modes and \"see how long you can survive\" modes. Besides the normal modes, you can also get \"Extra\" modes, which allow you to use the weapons you buy in Weapon Master mode. The weapons can give that little boost needed for victory. Most weapons have a pro and a con, like a staff that has good offense and recovers health, but has poor defense. The higher the cost of the weapon, the better it is. Some weapons have no flaws, like the katana Masamune, which has good offense and defense, with no downside. The in-combat gameplay is good. There are a number of actions, like Guard Impacts (which reverse or trip an enemy's attack), to prevent button mashing. This game is responsible for the most fulfilling fighting round in any fighting game I've ever played. My character was Mitsurugi, the Japanese swordsman, and my opponent was Raphael, the fencer. In most games, the victor would basically be whoever bashed most first. However, in this game, I actually had to think about it. There was thrusting, parrying, slashing, and basically everything that makes a game seem realistic and not just a \"bash, mash, smash\" game. The other moves that can be done range from ninja teleportation to awesome throws. The main reason to buy certain console versions of this game is the \"guest character\" on each one: Link for the Gamecube, Spawn for the Xbox, and Tekken's Heihachi (who uses, well, gloves as his weapon). Also in the game is a character not seen in the video arcade games: Necrid, a special character designed by Spawn's owner, Todd McFarlane (which is why Spawn is the Xbox's guest character and why McFarlane toys manufactures the action figures). As for being \"kid-friendly\", there is no blood, as hits make strange glowing/electrical red spots (but not cuts or slashes). There is some minor swearing (from characters that don't take losing well) and there is some \"female character bounciness\" and skimpy costumes, though each character has at least two costumes, and the alternate costumes on the skimpy characters are usually less bouncy and revealing. This is a very good, fun, and attention-holding fighting game, with only a few clipping errors (objects accidentally going through other objects). It gets a 10/10.</td><td>Amazing gameplay and graphics</td><td>1063238400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>76383</td><td>5.0</td><td>43</td><td>false</td><td>09 10, 2006</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000BLM5PG</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>If you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto, then you should definitely check out Saints Row. This GTA style game features the gang attacks, carjacking and other mature fun that can be played for months. Let me first make it clear that this was never intended to be a game for kids. There is a TON of hard core swearing, and it is pretty much constant. Even walking the streets gets you baragged with swearing. Your missions involve driving prostitutes around and listening to them \"at work\", helping drug dealers make their rounds, bashing up gang members in very violent ways, and so on. This is very clearly aimed towards a mature market, the kind that loves to watch The Sopranos and Scarface. That being said, Saint's Row provides extremely fun escapist fantasy for those who enjoy those worlds. The graphics quality is extremely impressive. You get day-night cycles, and the sunset with the twinkling stars is gorgeous. Each area of your city has its own personality. You can really enjoy walking along the chinatown waterfront in the early morning. The cars have fun touches like spinning wheel add-ons. Many things that were annoying about the Grand Theft Auto series are fixed here. I like the aiming system much better, I like how it saves and how it handles death in missions. Most of the minigames are quite fun and ramp up in difficulty at a reasonable rate. For example you can - right from the start - do a ton of \"Insurance Fraud\" missions and get just about as much money as you could possibly want, and respect as well. Even the basic character customization is impressive. You can be caucasian, African-American, hispanic, or asian - with a lot of details on each type. Yes, you can only be a guy. Someday they'll let girls into these games, in a way other than a prostitute! The hair, tattoo, body piercings, clothing, etc. choices are pretty impressive. The voice acting is stellar. You get David Carradine, Keith David, Michael Clarke Duncan, Tia Carrere, and much more. It really helps you to get involved in the storyline.  The story is sometimes predictable, but heck, this is a gang story. Of course you know that your gang will gain power while you defeat the others. It wouldn't be much of a game if your gang was destroyed quickly :) There are of course a few things they could have done better. There aren't motorcycles. There are a few strange glitches - like when you're hit by a car sometimes and fly up, it teleports you to a train station. The game has frozen once or twice but it seems to be after full-day gaming marathons, so it could easily be the XBox having a temporary meltdown. The cars don't seem to be affected much by damage. In general, this is amazingly fun to play, the world is simply fun to \"be in\" with its graphics and details, and there are always new things to do. Highly, highly recommended for a mature gamer.</td><td>Highly Recommended for the Mature Gamer</td><td>1157846400</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>79964</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 1, 2012</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B000F1YHW6</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Some games port well to the PSP and others aren't quite as smooth. I'm quite pleased with Tekken Dark Resurrection on the PSP; it's a quite good version of the PS2 game Tekken 5. The tutorial gets you grounded well in the navigation and moves you'll need. Then you head right into the fighting. The levels you play on are detailed, from the texture of the ground to the autumn leaves. The characters are equally detailed in their outfits. The sound is reasonably OK. I enjoy the wealth of characters, the personalities, and the variety of attacks. This is a game I can keep playing and playing because there are always new combinations to explore. If you own a PSP and enjoy fighting games, I highly recommend getting your hands on this one.</td><td>Great Fighting Fun</td><td>1346457600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>games</td><td>43344</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 1, 2010</td><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>B00008H2IS</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>\"Soul Caliber II\", for the Gamecube, Xbox, and Playstation 2, is a weapon-based fighting game.
